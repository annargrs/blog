&lt;p&gt;What comes below is an attempt to bring together some discussions on the state of NLP research post-chatGPT.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We are NLP researchers, and at the absolute minimum our job is to preserve the fundamentals of scientific methodology. This post is primarily addressed to junior NLP researchers, but is also relevant for other members of the community who are wondering how the existence of such models should change their next paper. We make the case that as far as research and scientific publications are concerned, the ‚Äúclosed‚Äù models (as defined below) cannot be meaningfully studied, and they should not become a ‚Äúuniversal baseline‚Äù, the way BERT was for some time widely considered to be. The TLDR for this post is a simple proposed rule for reviewers and chairs (akin to the Bender rule that requires naming the studied languages):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That which is not open and reasonably reproducible cannot be considered a requisite baseline.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By ‚Äúopen‚Äù we mean here that the model is available for download, can be run offline (even if it takes non-trivial compute resources), and can be shared with other users even if the original provider no longer offers the model for download. ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù models support versioning, and document for each model version what training data they used. A model is ‚Äúclosed‚Äù if it is not open.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By ‚Äúreasonably reproducible‚Äù we mean that the creators released enough information publicly such that the model can be reproduced with the provided code, data, and specified compute resources, with some variation reasonably expected due to hardware/software variance, data attrition factors and non-determinism in neural networks. For instance, reproducing &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom&quot;&gt;BLOOM&lt;/a&gt; would require a super-computer - but at least theoretically it is possible, given the measures to open-source the code, collect and document the data. So it is ‚Äúreasonably reproducible‚Äù by our definition, even though not everybody could do it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;relevance--popularity&quot;&gt;Relevance != popularity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs a question many graduate students in NLP have been asking themselves recently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;üßµWhat can graduate student researchers in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/NLProc?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#NLProc&lt;/a&gt; do to stay relevant in a competitive research environment with disruptive technologies happening in the industry? A thread. 1/N&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; William Wang (@WilliamWangNLP) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WilliamWangNLP/status/1638328550247002113?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 21, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This anxiety seems to be due partly to the fact that in our field, &lt;strong&gt;‚Äúrelevance‚Äù has been extremely popularity-driven&lt;/strong&gt;. For the last decade, there has always been a Thing-Everybody-Is-Talking-About: a model or approach that would become a yardstick, a baseline that everybody would be wise to have in their papers to show that what they‚Äôve done is a meaningful improvement. This can be understood, since one of the driving &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3531146.3533083&quot;&gt;values&lt;/a&gt; of the ML community is improving upon past work ‚Äì otherwise, how would we know we are making progress, right? Post-2013 we had word2vec/GloVe, then there was a similar craze about BERT. Then GPT-3. And now ‚Äì ChatGPT and GPT-4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does this happen? There are two lines of reasoning behind this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The-Thing-Everybody-Is-Talking-About is either likely to be truly state-of-the-art for whatever I‚Äôm doing, or a reasonable baseline, so I better have it in my paper and beat it with my model.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As an author, my chances of publication depend in part on the reviewers liking my work, and hence the safest bet for me is to talk about something that most people are likely to be interested in - a.k.a The-Thing-Everybody-Is-Talking-About.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(b) is actually a self-fulfilling prophecy: the more authors think this way, the more papers they write using The-Thing-Everybody-Is-Talking-About, which in turn reinforces the reviewers in the belief that that thing is really prerequisite. We see this cycle manifested as a mismatch between the beliefs of individual community members and their perception of others‚Äô views on what research directions should be prioritized (e.g. focus on benchmarks or scale), as documented in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nlpsurvey.net/&quot;&gt;NLP Community Metasurvey&lt;/a&gt;. Though it takes effort, members of the research community can push back against that kind of cycle (and we will discuss specific &lt;a href=&quot;#we-do-have-options&quot;&gt;strategies&lt;/a&gt; for that below).  As for (a) - it made sense while The-Thing-Everybody-Is-Talking-About was actually something that one could meaningfully compare to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main point we would like to make is that this kind of reasoning simply no longer applies to closed models that do not disclose enough information about their architecture, training setup, data, and operations happening at inference time. It just doesn‚Äôt matter how many people say that they work well. Even without going into the dubious ethics of commercial LLMs, with copyright infringement lawsuits over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-is-being-sued-over-github-copilot-piracy&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/artists-file-class-action-lawsuit-against-ai-image-generator-companies/&quot;&gt;art&lt;/a&gt; already underway, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/&quot;&gt;unethically sourced labeled data&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äì the basic research methodology demands it. Many, many people are bringing up the fact that as researchers, we are now in an impossible position:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have very little idea what these models are trained on, or how:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Most of these AI systems are *closed-source*. ChatGPT can literally be 3 raccoons in a trenchcoat, and we wouldn&amp;#39;t be the wiser. That means that there is no way to study them from a scientific perspective, since we don&amp;#39;t know that&amp;#39;s in the box (5/n) &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/uvFPyO5eIx&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/uvFPyO5eIx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dr. Sasha Luccioni üíªüåéü¶ã‚ú®ü§ó (@SashaMTL) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SashaMTL/status/1631239223020855298?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 2, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It is entirely possible that this very problem was entered in ChatGPT (perhaps because of my tweet) and subsequently made its way into the human-rated training set used to fine-tune GPT-4. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/YEHgPEquXp&quot;&gt;https://t.co/YEHgPEquXp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Yann LeCun (@ylecun) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1639685628722806786?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 25, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Both our incoming prompts and outgoing answers may be undergoing unspecified edits via unspecified mechanisms. E.g. chatGPT ‚Äúself-sensors‚Äù with content filters which people have so much fun bypassing, and has proprietary prompt prefixes:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;One unique thing about ChatGPT is that the content filter is **part of the model itself**, not an external model (and/or ruleset). That means users can interact with it via dialogue, and bypass it or get ChatGPT to turn it off. People have found a growing list of ways to do that. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/4s42qRWggV&quot;&gt;https://t.co/4s42qRWggV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Arvind Narayanan (@random_walker) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/random_walker/status/1598731969432780803?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 2, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, these models do seem impressive to many people in practice ‚Äì but as researchers, our job is not to buy into hype. The companies training these models have the right to choose to be wholly commercial and therefore not open to independent scrutiny ‚Äì that is expected of for-profit entities whose main purpose is to generate profits for their stakeholders. &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;But this necessarily means that they relinquish the role of scientific researchers.&lt;/span&gt; As Gary Marcus &lt;a href=&quot;https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/the-sparks-of-agi-or-the-end-of-science?publication_id=888615&quot;&gt;put&lt;/a&gt; it,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt expect Coca Cola to present its secret formula. But nor do I plan to give them scientific credibility for alleged advances that we know nothing about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-closed-models-as-requisite-baselines-would-break-nlp-research-narratives&quot;&gt;Why closed models as requisite baselines would break NLP research narratives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make things more concrete, let us consider a few frequent ‚Äúresearch narratives‚Äù in NLP papers, and how they would be affected by using such ‚Äúclosed‚Äù models as baselines. We will use GPT-4 as a running example of a ‚Äúclosed‚Äù model that was released with &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtualizationreview.com/articles/2023/03/15/gpt-4-details.aspx&quot;&gt;almost no technical details&lt;/a&gt;, despite being the subject of a 100-page report singing its praises, but the same points apply to other such models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-propose-a-machine-learning-model-that-improves-on-the-state-of-the-art&quot;&gt;‚ÄúWe propose a machine learning model that improves on the state-of-the-art‚Äù:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To make the claim that our algorithm improves over whatever it is that a commercial model is doing, we need to at least know that we are doing something qualitatively different. If we are proposing some modification of a currently-popular approach (e.g., Transformers), without documentation, we simply cannot exclude that the ‚Äúclosed‚Äù model might be doing something similar.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even if we believe that we are doing something qualitatively different, we still need to be able to claim that any improvements are due to our proposed modification and not model size, the type and amount of data, important hyperparameters, ‚Äúlucky‚Äù random seed, etc. Since we don‚Äôt have any of this information for the closed ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù, we cannot meaningfully compare our model to it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And even if we ignore all the above factors ‚Äì to make a fair comparison with these models on some performance metric, we have to at least know that neither of our models has observed the test data. Which, for the ‚Äúclosed‚Äù model, we also don‚Äôt know. Even OpenAI itself was initially concerned about &lt;a href=&quot;https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/1457c0d6bfcb4967418bfb8ac142f64a-Abstract.html&quot;&gt;test data contamination with GPT-3&lt;/a&gt;, which could not possibly have improved - especially after the whole world has obligingly tested chatGPT for months. And it &lt;a href=&quot;https://towardsdatascience.com/the-decontaminated-evaluation-of-gpt-4-38a27fc45c30&quot;&gt;hasn‚Äôt improved&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing that we as model developers can learn from the existence of GPT-4, is that this is the kind of performance that can be obtained with some unspecified combination of current methods and data. An upper bound or existence proof, which seems higher than existing alternatives. &lt;strong&gt;Upper bounds are important, and could serve as a source of motivation for our work, but they cannot be used as a point of comparison.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-propose-a-new-challenging-taskbenchmarkmetric&quot;&gt;‚ÄúWe propose a new challenging task/benchmark/metric‚Äù:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constructing good evaluation data is very hard and expensive work, and it makes sense to invest in it when we believe that it can be used as a public benchmark to measure progress in NLP models, at least for a few months. Examples of such benchmarks that have driven NLP research in the past include &lt;a href=&quot;https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/&quot;&gt;SQuAD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gluebenchmark.com/&quot;&gt;GLUE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/BIG-bench&quot;&gt;BigBench&lt;/a&gt;. But public benchmarks can only work if the test data remains hidden (and even then &lt;a href=&quot;https://laurenoakdenrayner.com/2019/09/19/ai-competitions-dont-produce-useful-models/&quot;&gt;eventually people evaluate too many times&lt;/a&gt; and start to implicitly overfit). This is obviously incompatible with the scenario where the developer of the popular ‚Äúclosed‚Äù models, only accessible via API, keeps our submitted data and may use it for training. And unless the models explicitly describe &lt;em&gt;and share&lt;/em&gt; their training data, we have no way of auditing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that our efforts will be basically single-use as far as the models by that developer are concerned. The next iteration will likely ‚Äúace‚Äù it (but not for the right reasons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us consider OpenAI policies in this respect:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ChatGPT &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7039943-data-usage-for-consumer-services-faq&quot;&gt;by default keeps your data and may use it for training&lt;/a&gt;. It is said to provide an &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7039943-data-usage-for-consumer-services-faq&quot;&gt;opt-out&lt;/a&gt; of data collection.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies&quot;&gt;OpenAI API policy&lt;/a&gt; was updated on March 1 2023, and currently states that by default data is not retained and not used for training. Whatever was submitted before this date, can be used, so we can safely assume that much if not all of existing public benchmark data has been submitted to GPT-3 since 2020, including the labels or ‚Äúgold‚Äù answers - at least those that were used as few-shot prompts. Interestingly, OpenAI then uses the contamination as a reason to exclude some evaluations but not others: the GPT4 tech report says that they did not evaluate on BIG-bench because of data contamination (in &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774v3&quot;&gt;v.3&lt;/a&gt; of the report it‚Äôs footnote 5 on p.6), although they do present their results for 100% contaminated GRE writing exams (Table 9).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall problem is that opt-outs and even opt-ins are not sufficient in the case of something meant to be a public benchmark: as dataset creators, the future of our work might be affected not only by our own use of our data - but also by anybody else using it! It takes just one other researcher who wasn‚Äôt careful to opt-out, or wasn‚Äôt able to ‚Äì and our data is ‚Äúpoisoned‚Äù with respect to future models by that developer. Even if only some few-shot examples are submitted, they might be used to somehow auto-augment similar user prompts. Last but not least, if we make our data public, the model developers themselves could also proactively add it to the training data, looking to improve their model. If the labels or the ‚Äúgold‚Äù answers are not public for an important benchmark, it would be worthwhile for them to create some similar data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs unclear yet how to solve this problem. Perhaps there will soon appear some special version of robots.txt that both prohibits use for AI training, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; requires that any resharing of this data keeps the same flag. And, hopefully, the large companies will eventually be required to comply, and be subject to audits. &lt;strong&gt;In the short-term, it seems like the only option is to simply not trust or produce benchmark results for models where test-train overlap analysis cannot be performed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-show-that-model-x-doesdoesnt-do-y-model-analysis-and-interpretability&quot;&gt;‚ÄúWe show that model X does/doesn‚Äôt do Y: (model analysis and interpretability)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we only have access to GPT-4 via the API, we can only probe model outputs. If the plan is to use existing probing datasets or construct new ones, we have the same resource problem described above (the previously used probing datasets might have been trained on, the previously used techniques could have been optimized for, the new work will be single-use, and still have the train-test overlap problem to an unknown extent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, at least some of these models seem to intentionally not produce identical outputs when queried with the same probe and settings (perhaps via random seeds or different versions of the model being used in parallel). In this case, whatever results we get may already be different for someone else, which puts our basic conclusions at risk. This could include, for instance, the reviewers of the paper, who will rightfully conclude that what our report may not be true. Moreover, if the developer keeps tweaking the model as we go, then by the time we finish writing the paper, the model could change (perhaps even based on our own data). Which would also make our work not only obsolete before it is even reviewed, but also incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue might be addressed by ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù given versions of the model and committing to keep them available to researchers, but there is hardly any incentive&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for for-profit companies to do so. For instance, some popular models including Codex/code-davinci-002 have already been &lt;a href=&quot;https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3&quot;&gt;deprecated&lt;/a&gt;. We also have no public information about what changes lead or do not lead to a new version number (and it is likely that at least the filters are updated continually, as users are trying to break the model).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, consider the effect of showing that model X does/doesn‚Äôt do Y:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúModel does Y‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;: without test-train overlap guarantees this is not necessarily a statement about the model. For example, chatGPT was reported to be able to play chess (&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@ivanreznikov/how-good-is-chatgpt-at-playing-chess-spoiler-youll-be-impressed-35b2d3ac024a&quot;&gt;badly&lt;/a&gt;). That looks unexpected of something that you consider a language model, but if you knew that it has seen a lot of chess data - it is hardly newsworthy that a language model can predict a plausible-looking sequence of moves. Basically, instead of discovering properties of a language model (which could be a research finding), we‚Äôre discovering that the internet dump it was trained on contained some chess data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‚Äú&lt;em&gt;Model doesn‚Äôt do Y&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù: by collecting cases where the model seems to fail, we implicitly help the commercial entity controlling that model to ‚Äúfix‚Äù those specific cases, and further blur the line between ‚Äúemergent‚Äù language model properties and test cases leaked in training. In fact, GPT-4 was already trained on user interactions gathered during the mass testing of ChatGPT, which provided Open AI with millions of free examples, including ‚Äúcorrected‚Äù responses to prompts submitted by users. In the long run, our work would make it harder for the next researcher to examine the next ‚Äúclosed‚Äù model. What‚Äôs even worse, it would decrease the number of easy-to-spot errors that might prevent ordinary users from falling for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect&quot;&gt;Eliza effect&lt;/a&gt;, hence increasing their trust in these systems (even though they are still fundamentally unreliable).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In summary, by showing that a closed model X does/doesn‚Äôt do Y we would likely not contribute to the general understanding of such models, and/or exacerbate the evaluation issues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-show-that-model-x-is-unfairbiased-etc-ai-ethics&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‚ÄúWe show that model X is (un)fair/biased etc‚Äù:&lt;/strong&gt; (AI ethics)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us say that we somehow showed that the closed model yields some specific type of misinformation or misrepresents a given identity group (as it was done e.g. for &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3461702.3462624&quot;&gt;anti-Muslim bias in GPT-3&lt;/a&gt;). The most likely outcome for such work is that this specific kind of output will be quickly ‚Äúpatched‚Äù, perhaps before we even publish the paper. The result is that (a) our hard work is short-lived, which may matter for researcher careers, (b) we actively helped the company make their model &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; more ethical, while their training data probably didn‚Äôt fundamentally change, and hence the model probably still encodes the harmful stereotypes that could manifest themselves in other ways. Consider how in &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06323&quot;&gt;Dall-E 2&lt;/a&gt; the gender and identity terms were randomly added to make outputs seem more diverse, as opposed to showing the default identity groups (read: White Men).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, should we just forgo studying ‚Äúclosed‚Äù models from the ethics angle? Of course not: &lt;strong&gt;independent analysis on commercial systems is strictly necessary. But we need to figure out ways to do this without providing companies with free data with which to mask the symptoms of the underlying problem.&lt;/strong&gt; Here are some alternatives that may lean on skillsets that NLP researchers are still developing, and perhaps will be strengthened by collaborations with experts in HCI and social sciences:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;User studies on whether people trust the over-simplified chatbot answers, how likely they are to verify information, whether students use it in ways that actually improves their learning outcomes, and interventions that promote safer use practices. This kind of work focuses on the potential effects of these models, given the known phenomenon of automation bias, and any negative findings can only be refuted with a public user study.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discussing and documenting instances of real-world harms, where they can be traced to the model (akin to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922&quot;&gt;Stochastic Parrots&lt;/a&gt; paper). Ideally, such cases would require not only a fix, but also public acknowledgment and hopefully compensation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;User studies of various demographic cohorts, to see if the system works equally well for them in different real-world tasks: something with qualitative evaluation, where a fix would require obtaining better training data for that cohort. But this kind of work would need to somehow avoid producing too much concrete evidence that could be used to simply ‚Äúpatch‚Äù the output.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Studies not just of these systems, but on their intended and real impact on society. We need a lot of research on system-level issues where a ‚Äúfix‚Äù would require changes to the business model and/or the way these systems are presented and marketed. An obvious example is the jobs that are too risky to be automated with the unreliable, biased, hallucination-prone systems that we currently have. For instance, do policy-makers jump on the opportunity to hire fewer teachers, and what kinds of schools are more likely to be sent down that path?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-develop-a-more-efficient-solution-than-model-x&quot;&gt;‚ÄúWe develop a more efficient solution than model X‚Äù:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reviewers would likely (and rightly) expect us to show that we improve efficiency while maintaining a similar level of performance, which means we inherit all the above evaluation issues. Also, we likely don‚Äôt even have enough details about the training of the ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù, including its computational costs, the amount and source of energy invested in it, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-do-have-options&quot;&gt;We Do Have Options!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear members of the NLP community: the good news is that if you‚Äôd like to do‚Ä¶ you know‚Ä¶ actual &lt;em&gt;research&lt;/em&gt; on language models, you do have open options, and more of them will probably be coming, as the cost of training goes down. &lt;strong&gt;Here are a few examples of models that come not only with reasonable descriptions of their training data, but even tools to query it&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the reviewers who might say ‚Äúbut where‚Äôs GPT-4?‚Äù&lt;/strong&gt; Here‚Äôs what you can do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preemptively discuss in your paper why you don‚Äôt provide e.g. chatGPT results as a baseline, before your paper is submitted.  If necessary, use the arguments in this post in your rebuttals to reviewers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preemptively raise the issue with the chairs of the conference you plan to submit to, to ask if they have a policy against such superficial popularity-driven reviews. The ACL 2023 &lt;a href=&quot;https://2023.aclweb.org/blog/review-acl23/#2-check-for-lazy-thinking&quot;&gt;policy&lt;/a&gt; didn‚Äôt cover this, since the problem became apparent after the submission deadline, but it can be extended by future chairs. We will be following any policy discussions related to this in ACL conferences; if you have any comments, or if there are any major developments and if you‚Äôd like us to keep you in the loop - please use this &lt;a href=&quot;https://forms.gle/N2Gakzk8xF6V9aTr5&quot;&gt;form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a reviewer or chair, if you see someone insisting on closed baselines - side with the authors and push back.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discuss these matters openly in your own community; as reviewers, we can continue to educate and influence each other to drive our norms to a better place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another question outside of the scope of this post, but that could be brought up for community discussion in the future, is whether the ‚Äúclosed‚Äù models should be accepted as regular conference submissions (in direct competition with ‚Äúopen‚Äù work for conference acceptance and best paper awards) ‚Äì or perhaps it is time to reconsider the role of the ‚Äúindustry‚Äù track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our community is at a turning point, and you can help to direct the new community norms to follow science rather than hype ‚Äì both as an author and as a reviewer&lt;/strong&gt;. The more people cite and study the best available open solutions, the more we incentivize open and transparent research, and the more likely it is that the next open solution will be much better. After all, it is our tradition of open research that has made our community so successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;addendum-counter-arguments&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addendum: counter-arguments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Train-test overlap and uninspected training data has always been an issue, ever since we started doing transfer learning with word2vec and onwards. Why protest now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have in fact been raising that issue many times before. Again, even OpenAI itself devoted a big chunk of the GPT-3 paper to the issues with benchmark data contamination. The fact that an issue is old doesn‚Äôt make it a non-issue; it rather makes us a field with a decade of methodological debt, which doesn‚Äôt make sense to just keep accruing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The-Closed-Model-Everybody-Is-Talking-About does seem to work better for this task than my model or open alternatives, how can I just ignore it and claim state-of-the-art?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt. ‚ÄúState-of-the-art‚Äù claims expire in a few months anyway. Be more specific, and just show improvement over the best open solution. Let‚Äôs say that in your task ChatGPT is clearly, obviously better than open alternatives, based on your own small testing with your own examples. What you don‚Äôt know is whether this is mostly due to some clever model architecture, or some proprietary data. In the latter case, your scientific finding would be‚Ä¶ that models work best on data similar to what they were trained on. Not exactly revolutionary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, ask yourself: are you sure that the impressive behavior you are observing is the result of pure generalization? As mentioned above, there is no way to tell how similar your test examples are to the training data. And that training data could include examples submitted by other researchers working on this topic, examples that were not part of any public dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The-Closed-Model-Everybody-Is-Talking-About does seem to work better for this task than my model or open alternatives, how can I just ignore it and not build on it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That has indeed been the pathway to many, many NLP publications in the past: take an existing problem and the newest thing-that-everybody-is-talking-about, put them together, show improvement over previous approaches, publish. The problem is that with an API-access closed model you do not actually ‚Äúbuild‚Äù on it; at best you formulate new prompts (and hope that they transfer across different model versions). If your goal is engineering, if you just need something that works - this might be sufficient. But if you are after a scientific contribution to machine learning theory or methods - this will necessarily reduce the perceived value of your work for the reviewers. And if the claim is that you found some new ‚Äúbehavior‚Äù that enables your solution, and hasn‚Äôt been noticed before - you will still need to show that this ‚Äúbehavior‚Äù cannot be explained by the training data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whatever we may say, The-Closed-Model-Everybody-Is-Talking-About is on everyone‚Äôs minds. People are interested in it. If I don‚Äôt publish on it, somebody else will and get more credit than me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that is a personal choice: what do you want the credit for and who do you want recognition from? Publishing on the ‚Äúhottest‚Äù thing might work short-term, but, as shown above, if we simply follow the traditional NLP research narratives with these models as new requisite baselines in place of BERT, our work will be either fundamentally divorced from the basic principles of research methodology, or extremely short-lived, or both. Imagine looking at the list of your published papers 10 years from now: do you want it to be longer, or containing more things that you are proud of long-term?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there other ways to study these models that would not run into these issues? We discussed some such ways for ethics-oriented research, perhaps there are other options as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can‚Äôt we just study very made-up examples that are unlikely to have been in training data?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, if the point is to learn something about what that model does with real data - very artificial examples could be handled in some qualitatively different way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, at this point you need to be sure that you are way more original than all those other folks who tested chatGPT for several months. Especially since the data used for RLHF comes from interactions with GPT3 - perhaps even your own!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, you would still need to know what part actually hasn‚Äôt been seen. For example, ChatGPT was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tqbf/status/1598513757805858820?s=20&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; to write a fable about a peanut butter sandwich stuck in a VCR, in King James Bible style, and that example got subsequently shared in dozens of media articles. This &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a cool example, but what exactly is it that we believe to be impressive? The style transfer, the knowledge that things get stuck in VCRs, the plausible instructions? The degree of impressiveness of each one of these depends on what was in the training data. And even the impressiveness of the ability to tie these things together still depends on what combinations of ‚Äúskills‚Äù were seen in training, and whether this is in fact a pure language model behavior, and not some combination of pipeline components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tried to reproduce that answer, but accidentally typed ‚ÄúCVR‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúVCR‚Äù. The result was very illuminating. We got generic instructions that could have come from something like WikiHow: how to wipe off something sticky off something electric. Which, of course, is no good here: a sandwich includes a large piece of bread, which you would need to remove by hand rather than by wiping it off. But the best part is that the model later ‚Äúadmitted‚Äù it had no idea what ‚ÄúCVR‚Äù was! (Indeed, large language models don‚Äôt inherently ‚Äúknow‚Äù anything about the world). And then, when prompted for ‚ÄúVCR‚Äù, apparently the directive to maintain consistency within the dialogue overruled whatever it could have said about ‚ÄòVCR‚Äù‚Ä¶ so we got the same wrong instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20230330160934.png&quot; /&gt;

	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/20230330161005.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did go without a hitch is the paraphrasing in the King James style. But it‚Äôs hard to imagine that paraphrasing was not an intended-and-trained-for ‚Äúcapability‚Äù, or that this style was not well represented in a large web-based corpus - o ye of little faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it work well? Yes. Is it a magical ‚Äúemergent‚Äù property? No. Can we develop another paraphrasing system and meaningfully compare it to this one? Also no. And this is where it stops being relevant for NLP research. &lt;em&gt;That which is not open and reasonably reproducible cannot be considered a requisite baseline.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The work on this post started a while ago, and has nothing to do with either &lt;a href=&quot;https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/&quot;&gt;longtermism&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://laion.ai/blog/petition/&quot;&gt;plea&lt;/a&gt; for democratization of GPU resources.¬†&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;There are in fact incentives for such companies to close and deprecate previous versions of their models, for the sake of (a) reducing attack surface, (b) capping technical debt. These are legitimate concerns for commercial entities, but they are intrinsically in tension with their models being objects of scientific inquiry.¬†&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the discussion about large pre-trained generative models hits the question of ‚Äúwhat about all this work of artists, programmers and writers that is used in commercial products/models without their knowledge or consent?‚Äù, one of the arguments for why this is ok is the comparison of such models to latent search engines. It goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a human, you can and do search for inspiration in other people‚Äôs writing, code snippets and art. A generative model is similar, it just provides a convenient interface for a search over a huge amount of data as you go.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side note: this is about the ‚Äúlatent search‚Äù or ‚Äúsynthesis‚Äù of the training data that the generative models perform in the process of their regular generation process. There is a related, but separate discussion about using models as a replacement for index-based search engines. For example, &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#MetzlerTayEtAl_2021_Rethinking_search_making_domain_experts_out_of_dilettantes&quot;&gt;(Metzler, Tay, Bahri, &amp;amp; Najork, 2021)&lt;/a&gt; sets out a vision of models as ‚Äúdomain experts‚Äù generating authoritative answers to any questions that the user might have. &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#ShahBender_2022_Situating_Search&quot;&gt;(Shah &amp;amp; Bender, 2022)&lt;/a&gt; challenge this vision by discussing the many kinds of behavior that search users need to undertake which would simply not be supported by a ‚Äúdomain expert‚Äù model trying to generate one definitive answer (e.g. learning more before refining their question, considering the list of options, the incentives behind different sources, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what‚Äôs wrong with the ‚Äúlatent search engine‚Äù view of generative models?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is obviously true that autoregressive language models do search for the most probable completion based on the prompt. And it is equally true that human writing and art is conditioned on the inputs encountered by the said humans in their lives, as well as relevant inputs that were deliberately sought out in response to a particular challenge. In literary studies and art there is the notion of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertextuality&quot;&gt;intertextuality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Bakhtin_1981_Discourse_in_novel&quot;&gt;(Bakhtin, 1981; Kristeva, 1980; Barthes, 1977)&lt;/a&gt;, covering a wide range of ways in which different texts/artworks are related (or perceived to be related by the reader), such as allusion, quotation, parody etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are a few important limitations to this analogy, including the fundamental differences in the mechanism behind the generative models and  the human inspiration, the potential scale of societal impact for commercial models, and a very different set of stakeholders and benefactors. This post focuses on one particular point in which the search engine analogy breaks down: the attribution problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-attribution-problem&quot;&gt;The attribution problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you use a search engine, you find a specific idea, artwork or code snippet for which you clearly see the source. There is a reference (even if the source is only known as stackoverflow user02348). Importantly, there is &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; illusion that any thought/artwork/code is just there to be freely appropriated as your own work. If your search space is not the web but your own memory or life experience, you still usually know the sources for things that are citation-worthy (or you go on Twitter asking people ‚Äúwhat was that movie/book/project/paper that had/did X?‚Äù)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a researcher, you likely have something like  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zotero.org/&quot;&gt;Zotero&lt;/a&gt; to track references for you, and a huge database of books and papers. Even if your source by itself was sourced from elsewhere, and even if someone said the same thing without your knowing it ‚Äì your credibility before your readers (and yourself) requires that you disclose the references that you do know. In the process of doing so, you will necessarily have to make sure that you actually believe the source to be reliable, and that you are aware of its role in your own reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the attribution problem goes both ways: claiming full credit for the result of your work is possible if and only if you know and cite your sources. This is completely orthogonal to the degree of originality. Let‚Äôs say I publish this blog post and then I find that exactly the same text has already been published by someone else: I would still know that what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; published was my own work. On the other hand, if instead of writing this blog post I asked GPT-3 to generate it, and even got exactly the same result - I could not claim any contribution at all. In publishing that text as my own, my role would be only to say ‚ÄúI interpret this as coherent text and agree with its content‚Äù (that‚Äôs what I think Jack Clark did when he &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jackclarkSF/status/1575525910643474435&quot;&gt;used&lt;/a&gt; synthetic text as part of his Congress testimony). And what if I used GPT-3 to get ‚Äúideas‚Äù about what to write next - i.e. generating coherent sections of text that I would then edit - what exactly would I claim then?  Not sure. But the ideas, the style, the amount of background knowledge etc. would all be only partially mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/xlvygv/artifical_intelligence_allows_me_to_get_straight/&quot;&gt;Reddit discussion&lt;/a&gt; of how GPT-3 starts to get popular with students aiming to avoid doing their essays. Apart from the students‚Äô completely misunderstanding the point of the exercise, and the waste of the teachers‚Äô time, this discussion highlighted an idea that the AI-assisted writer actually gets the credit not for the writing, but for the ‚Äústreet smarts‚Äù: their ability to game the system and get high grades, even if their language skills are not so great. Some might be tempted to say that this is just like using a spellchecker or a service like Grammarly to improve one‚Äôs writing, but it seems clear that generating a full or partial draft is qualitatively different: you get help not only with the linguistic form, but also the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-arent-people-doing-the-same-thing&quot;&gt;But aren‚Äôt people doing the same thing?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, of course people build on other people‚Äôs work all the time. If you want to use something, you can do that - but society has worked out quite a few norms about how much of your own work has to go into the result. And because those norms have evolved over time, we are usually quite aware of our sources. Maybe not all of them, but the important ones for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any musician has listened to other music that influenced them. Art students go to galleries, and creative writing students read other people‚Äôs books. They and/or their teachers may even deliberately curate what they are exposed to, so as to get to a particular result. And all of them can give an interview with some account of their formative influences. That account will be incomplete and not coinciding with what the critics think, but that‚Äôs not the point: only that people do generally retain at least some memories of things that ended up very important for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key difference is that if they aim to be an original artist/musician/writer, while they build on prior work, the point is always to add enough of their own thinking that the next generation has something to similarly learn from &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; (and not only their ‚Äòsources‚Äô). It is far from clear that we get that same degree of creativity from generative models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regard to AI art in particular: I‚Äôm not an artist at all, but it seems that it‚Äôs actually the style (shapes, color schemes etc) rather than just the particular images/artifacts that the artist spends a lifetime developing, and that also brings them professional recognition. They seem to very much disagree that it is ok to just appropriate that &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Heikkila_2022_This_artist_is_dominating_AI-generated_art_And_hes_not_happy_about_it&quot;&gt;(Heikkil√§, 2022)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://spawning.ai/&quot;&gt;Spawning AI&lt;/a&gt; has built a &lt;a href=&quot;https://haveibeentrained.com/&quot;&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt; for artists to detect when their work has been part of popular training datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion: no, generative models are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; doing the same kind of latent search over the possible things they could ‚Äúsay‚Äù as the humans do when they produce texts or art. A key difference is that for humans it is not only a cognitive activity driven by content considerations, but also a social activity. We are acutely aware of when attribution is needed, we provide that attribution, and we expect attribution in return. Granted, different people may have a different sense of when attribution is appropriate (based on their personal experience, familiarity with a subject, the social norms in their environment, etc.) - but that does not make the fundamental principle any less real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;counter-arguments&quot;&gt;Counter-arguments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of discussion, here are some of the counter-arguments I have seen, and my responses to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;generative-models-are-sufficiently-creative&quot;&gt;Generative models are sufficiently creative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To claim that a generative model is sufficiently creative to not worry about attribution, we would first need to define ‚Äúcreativity‚Äù. Some bring up examples like DALL-E‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/&quot;&gt;avocado chairs&lt;/a&gt;. To me, the creativity here is exhibited by the human who formulated the crazy prompt, while the model demonstrates compositionality in being able to recombine the visual ‚Äúconcepts‚Äù it had learned (in this case it had learned ‚Äúchair‚Äù, ‚Äúwood‚Äù, and ‚Äúavocado‚Äù, as well as the visual schema ‚Äúchair + material‚Äù). Most of us cannot draw well, so pretty much any execution would look impressive. But consider what this compositional skill would look like in the language domain, where we are all proficient enough: the model learned ‚ÄúJohn had a coffee‚Äù and ‚ÄúMary had a tea‚Äù, and it was then able to produce ‚ÄúJohn had a tea‚Äù. Does that look as impressively creative as the avocado chair image?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wouldn‚Äôt interpret creativity as randomness (e.g. as controlled by the temperature setting of GPT-3). If I were to get the writer‚Äôs block and had to resort to random writing prompts to get me unstuck, that would rather be a symptom of a &lt;em&gt;lack&lt;/em&gt; of creativity, wouldn‚Äôt it? Furthermore, with the current models increasing the randomness of generation is likely to sacrifice the factual correctness of the generated data, as it necessarily moves further away from the training distribution - and there are no mechanisms for conceptual consistency. Creativity/nonsense is not an acceptable trade-off in most scenarios where the generated text is anchored to the real world or some long-form narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, ‚Äúcreativity‚Äù may be discussed in publications on AI art or AI-human collaborations as some external characteristic of the generated text/artwork, scored by critics on some aesthetic dimensions, as in &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#HitsuwariUedaEtAl_2022_Does_human-AI_collaboration_lead_to_more_creative_art&quot;&gt;(Hitsuwari, Ueda, Yun, &amp;amp; Nomura, 2022)&lt;/a&gt;. I would argue that this is also not the relevant notion of creativity for this discussion. Since we are talking about a machine learning system, evaluation of any aesthetic properties of its output has the same problem as any other benchmarks: unless we know what the system saw in training, we cannot tell whether it actually acquired some ability or just parrots the seen examples. So far I have seen no studies of very large models given all their training data (given that this data is typically not made fully publicly available in a query-able form). Since fundamentally the current models are optimized to produce a statistically likely completion of the current prompt, the burden of proof is on the side that claims creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we do know from the studies with smaller models is that they can and do reproduce passages of training data verbatim &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#CarliniTramerEtAl_2021_Extracting_Training_Data_from_Large_Language_Models&quot;&gt;(Carlini et al., 2021; Carlini et al., 2022)&lt;/a&gt;, inter alia. The capacity for memorization and, hence, plagiarism would increase with size &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#LeeLeEtAl_2022_Do_Language_Models_Plagiarize&quot;&gt;(Lee, Le, Chen, &amp;amp; Lee, 2022)&lt;/a&gt;. Given that, I would argue that even if we had some general proof of &lt;em&gt;capacity&lt;/em&gt; for generative models to synthesize meaningful and original content, it would not be enough: after all, humans also &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be creative, but teachers still suspect student plagiarism on a case by case basis. For a statistical learner, how creative (or trustworthy) a given generation is would likely depend on how much evidence it had, and how similar the different datapoints were. So unless the company selling the model provides some guarantees of originality in specific cases, it simply passes the responsibility for the potential plagiarism on to its unwitting customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;can-we-just-add-references&quot;&gt;Can we just add references?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When presenting their vision of a ‚Äúdomain expert‚Äù end-to-end information retrieval, &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#MetzlerTayEtAl_2021_Rethinking_search_making_domain_experts_out_of_dilettantes&quot;&gt;(Metzler, Tay, Bahri, &amp;amp; Najork, 2021)&lt;/a&gt; argue for a model that does add some references, and moreover strives to present ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù for controversial topics. Perhaps it would be an easy fix for the attribution problem - if we just added pointers to the training data examples that were the most similar to the generated output?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre writing a deep learning blog post about self-attention in Transformers. Let‚Äôs say that your ‚Äúwriting aid‚Äù model would give you the following combination of sentences:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The self-attention mechanism in Transformers is able to compute pair-wise relations between patches globally, consequently achieving feature interactions across a long range. It is‚Ä¶ regarded as a mapping of query and key/value pairs to an output, each of which being represented by a vector. A well-known concern with self-attention‚Ä¶ is the quadratic time and memory complexity, which can hinder model scalability in many settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these sentences actually come from different research papers. Augmented with links to those papers, the same paragraph would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The self-attention mechanism in Transformers is able to compute pair-wise relations between patches globally, consequently achieving feature interactions across a long range. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.00462v2.pdf&quot;&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.00462v2.pdf&lt;/a&gt;] It is‚Ä¶ regarded as a mapping of query and key/value pairs to an output, each of which being represented by a vector [&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03052.pdf&quot;&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03052.pdf&lt;/a&gt;]. A well-known concern with self-attention‚Ä¶ is the quadratic time and memory complexity, which can hinder model scalability in many settings. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.06732.pdf&quot;&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.06732.pdf&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key difference is that the first paragraph &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; like something actually ‚Äúdone‚Äù by the model, and you might be tempted to actually use it. The references destroy the illusion of the attribution-free text: unless you are comfortable simply copying phrases from other people‚Äôs work, the ‚Äúwriting aid‚Äù illusion falls apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, this example is exaggerated: perhaps only some part of the generated text would be so clearly plagiarized. Perhaps it would only happen occasionally. But without these references the attribution norms in scientific community would still be broken. And with them, it would mean that you‚Äôre relying on GPT-3 for the high-level thinking behind your research. Which would make sense depending on (a) on the degree to which you believe it capable of such thinking, (b) if so - the degree to which you are comfortable taking credit for thinking that is not your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#ShahBender_2022_Situating_Search&quot;&gt;(Shah &amp;amp; Bender, 2022)&lt;/a&gt; make the case that the references approach is insufficient even for the ‚Äúdomain expert‚Äù QA model envisaged by &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#MetzlerTayEtAl_2021_Rethinking_search_making_domain_experts_out_of_dilettantes&quot;&gt;(Metzler, Tay, Bahri, &amp;amp; Najork, 2021)&lt;/a&gt;: the model may end up being the arbiter of truth for cases that are far from resolved, may present ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù on topics like the flat earth theory, and may obscure the real sources of information behind the citation (e.g. something called ‚ÄúXYZ clinic‚Äù may actually be a homeopathy provider with no medical credentials). Of course, there are cases in which the answer is straightforward enough to trust the current models with - but unfortunately we can‚Äôt easily tell which cases are ‚Äúsafe‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;if-you-go-deep-enough-everything-has-a-reference&quot;&gt;If you go deep enough, everything has a reference.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you go deep enough, everything has a reference. Nobody expects attribution for basic algebra or the English alphabet. Nobody has ethical qualms about writing with Grammarly or spell checkers. Why demand attribution for abstract ideas or artistic styles?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True, when we write academic articles nowadays, nobody expects you to provide the trail of references all the way down to Aristotle. But few people would say that taking someone‚Äôs recent NeurIPS paper and republishing it would be ok. Yes, it is a continuum, but it‚Äôs still real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What exactly is common knowledge and what deserves a reference at a given point in time varies by person, depending on their domain knowledge and principles. Still, everybody has a fairly clear idea of what their own boundaries are. Would you personally be comfortable with changing some variable names in a StackOverflow snippet and passing it as your own work? Would you tell your child it‚Äôs ok to copy-paste essay passages from public domain sources - after all, it‚Äôs not illegal? How about if you hear an apt metaphor in someone‚Äôs keynote that you haven‚Äôt heard anywhere else - would you say that it‚Äôs ‚Äújust English‚Äù and use it as your own? Whatever your answers are to these questions - you have these answers, which means that you have your own attribution norms. They matter to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;. And part of the reason you have this specific set of norms is that you know that this is what the people around you expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fair-use&quot;&gt;‚ÄúFair use‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is just luddism. The printing press put the calligraphers out of a job, and the world is better off this way. The notions of copyright and intellectual property are obsolete and will soon dissolve in ‚Äúfair use‚Äù. If that puts artists/writers/programmers out of work - so what, society just needs to adapt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The printing press wasn‚Äôt literally powered by the work of all the calligraphers in the world, taken and used commercially without their knowledge or consent - especially at a time when at least some protection against that already exists in contemporaneous laws. ‚ÄúFair use‚Äù may sound like a reasonable approach for academic research or for individual creators producing AI-assisted content (with proper source attribution), but that‚Äôs not what is under discussion - it‚Äôs the AI companies‚Äô right to use any data they can get hold of to train &lt;em&gt;commercial&lt;/em&gt; models, without sharing any proceeds with the original creators or even letting them know their work was used. That fight is far from over, and the few available court decisions (such as the ongoing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/linkedin-loses-latest-appeal-in-ongoing-data-scraping-case/622333/&quot;&gt;LinkedIn case&lt;/a&gt;) are on a case-by-case basis rather than something that the companies can already use as a blanket permission. An investigation for an actual lawsuit is underway with respect to GitHub CoPilot &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#JosephSaveriLawFirmButterick_2022_GitHub_Copilot_investigation&quot;&gt;(Joseph Saveri Law Firm &amp;amp; Butterick, 2022)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure what kind of adaptations on the part of society are being envisaged. Let us imagine one possible scenario: you are a programmer in a world dominated by a future CoPilot-like system which everybody uses, and which is trained on all public code. Any new public code of yours is fed to that system, and everybody else is instantly able to use it. Since there is no attribution, your public work can no longer help you to build up reputation, community and a professional profile that would be well known outside your current company, which would make it harder to change jobs should anything go wrong. Your employer knows this, and tweaks a few HR policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the future CoPilot owner works out some licensing scheme which gives you some royalties when your code snippets are used? This is where the platform power comes in, and we wish we hadn‚Äôt been so enthusiastic about ‚Äúfair use‚Äù for commerce. Fun fact: only 0.96% of the 7 million artists on Spotify made even $5K in 2020 &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Smith_2021_13400_Artists_Out_of_7_Million_Earn_$50k_or_More_From_Spotify_Yearly&quot;&gt;(Smith, 2021)&lt;/a&gt;. Only 0.19% (13,400 artists) out of 7 million artists were popular enough to make $50K a year.&lt;/p&gt;

I was able to attend thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.winlp.org/winlp-emnlp-2021/&quot;&gt;WiNLP&lt;/a&gt; travel award, for their panel on the role of peer review in diversifying NLP. &lt;em&gt;This was the first ever *ACL hybrid conference, and the chairs deserve applause for all their hard work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is meant not as a criticism, but rather as a post-mortem that would hopefully be useful for organizers of future events. I can only share my own experience, and would love to hear from others. This post does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; offer a comprehensive solution for to how to do this better - only some thoughts and comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Other shared impressions that I know of:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;(let me know if I‚Äôm missing any other posts)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;segregation-between-on-site-and-virtual-events&quot;&gt;Segregation between on-site and virtual events&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental issue is that the on-site conference experience is complete enough that people who are on-site have more than enough things to do without checking in on the virtual part. There were fewer people on-site than usual, but I think even 50 people would probably just keep chatting to each other full-time (as they did in the early days of ACL). Probably this time it was worse than average because this is the first on-site meeting after a year of lockdowns, and thus it was too much joy to see human faces again to exchange that for zoom. But I don‚Äôt think that this factor would ever go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if we are on-site it means we are tired from traveling and likely also jetlagged. I knew very well that virtual part was also going on, but I even missed a big chunk of the on-site program, because I just didn‚Äôt have the energy physically (and also had non-conference urgent stuff to do for ARR). The result was that I made it to the grand total of 1 virtual poster in the whole week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A part of the problem is that our conferences are just generally too big. In a regular pre-pandemic on-site conference there were already too many parallel sessions going on, and thus it was already hard enough to pick and choose, and get to the right rooms at the right time. If the hybrid format offers the on-site attendees a subset of that program that is ‚Äúlive‚Äù, and the rest of the talks are recorded anyway, I think simply following the on-site part will always be a too-tempting option. If some of the parallel sessions are virtual, the topical division imo wouldn‚Äôt offer sufficient incentive to attend them just for their topic, because most of us seem to have many research interests, and will likely always find some exciting work that happens to be presented on-site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why parallel on-site / virtual sessions are problematic. Unfortunately, they are also problematic when they are consecutive, because of the limited working hours in the on-site location. In day 1 there was a 9am invited talk, 4 oral sessions until 18:15, 45 min for dinner break, and then another 2-hour virtual poster session 19:00-21:00. Speaking for myself, I just cannot absorb this much of a conference in a day. I do see that evening/night virtual events make sense to accommodate the presenters who are inevitably going to be in some other time zone than the conference location, but this also inevitably contributes to the segregation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this segregation is obviously not great. &lt;strong&gt;The people who can afford to travel to conferences are the ones who have money, visas, health, AND time - and EACH of these criteria cuts off a LOT of people.&lt;/strong&gt; Money-wise, the student &amp;amp; diversity travel awards are better than nothing, but not a solution, as there will never be enough awards for all who deserves to come. Personally, I had zero travel support during my PhD, and without a visit to NAACL sponsored by ACL student research workshop I would probably &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be here today. I am acutely aware that my getting that funding likely meant that someone else didn‚Äôt, and maybe they were/would be a better researcher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all of these reasons, not to mention the environment, I have previously advocated for fully switching to virtual conferences. I do see that this would be taking a lot of joy out of science (for people with money, visas, health and time), and so there is little appetite for such extreme measures - especially in that demographic. I am also aware that students need to network with that demographic to find jobs, and those students who do get to conferences get an important competitive advantage, which they will not want to lose. But if the community decides that these two factors outweigh inclusivity and the solution is hybrid conferences - I really don‚Äôt think we have a recipe that works for both sides yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;technical-aspects-of-organization-notes-on-different-types-of-events-from-an-on-site-attendee-perspective&quot;&gt;Technical aspects of organization: notes on different types of events from an on-site attendee perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;keynotes--invited-talks&quot;&gt;Keynotes &amp;amp; invited talks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conference keynotes work great in the hybrid format, because only one thing is going on, it‚Äôs generally well attended, and everybody is there from both channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same was generally true of invited talks for workshops, even though there were several workshops in parallel, and so more competition for the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-site-talks&quot;&gt;On-site talks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the on-site talks the presenter being virtual or on-site didn‚Äôt make a lot of difference for me. But with only 5 minutes for questions, having to locate &amp;amp; open the chat on-site often seemed like too much effort. So I ended up mostly not doing it, unless I already had laptop open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions to papers work better as asynchronous chat, but it‚Äôd be nice to have some dedicated slots in the conference program to do that. And authors should get notified when there are questions for their papers. I had 2 papers, jetlag, and a workshop to organize, and so definitely did not have the presence of mind to keep checking on those chats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even without the hybrid thing, I think poster format for conferences is just inherently better than 15 min talks, and I heard many people say the same. Way more interactivity, can go in-depth and/or chat &amp;amp; brainstorm as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;posters&quot;&gt;Posters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hybrid poster sessions are a challenge. To have virtual attendees in the live poster sessions we‚Äôd have to have some kind of conference robots, which is just too expensive. Having separate on-site &amp;amp; virtual sessions deprives the virtual crowd of the former. If we have the on-site presenters also present virtually a second time, they get double exposure, which seems unfair to virtual-only participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shall we just give up on physical posters and switch to gather-town in perpetuity (provided that its infrastructure scales to be fast enough?) Yes, it‚Äôs amazing to be able to talk to people live, but see above: it doesn‚Äôt seem to be possible to do it in an inclusive way. Plus we have the lovely task, cost and eco footprint of printing &amp;amp; carrying those posters. In EMNLP 2019 I nearly lost my poster in Hong Kong airport, because I was so jetlagged after the flight!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While live interaction with &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; at the poster feels better (if you‚Äôre among the lucky ones to be on-site), I do think it is strictly inferior to gather-town in terms of interaction with the &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt;: it‚Äôs a lot easier to take notes, check up any papers mentioned in the discussion, tweet interesting stuff, look up people you ‚Äòrun‚Äô into. Have you ever come back from an on-site poster session with a phone full of poster photos that you never touched since? I certainly have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;panels&quot;&gt;Panels&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was an on-site panelist with two virtual panelists at WiNLP. The panel was great, but it presented a challenge I‚Äôve never thought about: camera positioning. The room had the standard setup of a large screen with the projected speaker view for the online participants, and in front of that screen was a chair for the on-site speaker facing the on-site audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the screen projecting the speaker view was behind me, I couldn‚Äôt see who I was talking to, and so had to have a laptop with zoom on a table in front of me. The end result was that the on-site people saw me stare at laptop in front of them, and virtual people saw a side view of me staring at the laptop. I honestly don‚Äôt know how this could be resolved. I hope this gets read by an academic whose hobby happens to be videography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;underline-grievances&quot;&gt;Underline grievances&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separate from the hybrid format is the heap of trouble with Underline.io, which EMNLP used for the hybrid part. This time the virtual attendance cost more, but the platform experience did not improve to justify that. As in ACL and NAACL 2021, it was slow, and the linking between papers, videos, live zooms and associated chats added a ton of friction. A one-click feature ‚Äúadd this to my schedule in my time zone‚Äù should NOT be so hard. On-site, we had to look for things both on underline, in whova, and in the printed handbook, as they sometimes had different information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; expect that in the closing remarks the speakers had to say ‚Äúnext‚Äù for someone to press the button to advance the slides. Definitely didn‚Äôt seem like we‚Äôre reaching for AGI yet‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this was the main conference. It was a lot worse for the workshops and tutorials, which did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; even have any schedules on the platform - except for their own websites, which would be harder for the attendees to cross-compare and make a composite schedule of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The on-site problems were so numerous that it‚Äôd be funny if it was not borderline disastrous. I heard that the crowdwourcing tutorial was assigned to an empty room without the set-up gear, and they had to run between rooms!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://insights-workshop.github.io&quot;&gt;Insights from Negative Results&lt;/a&gt; workshop, we started by losing 20 scheduled minutes because they gave us the same zoom link as another workshop. Then in another talk our on-site mike died and we couldn‚Äôt get through to the speaker who went overtime. And then they re-logged in for some reason, and that kicked the organizers out of the zoom altogether. For dessert, my own pre-submitted poster was simply missing in gather.town. They don‚Äôt even let people know if there are any problems with uploaded pdfs or videos. The underline team was on-site in sufficient numbers, but I couldn‚Äôt help wishing that I did not have to fetch them all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was part of the team for EMNLP 2020, which seems to have so far have delivered the best virtual conference experience with a combination of miniconf, gather.town and rocketchat. This was a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of work, and I totally see why subsequent conferences went with underline because it just seems like a one-stop infrastructure solution. But underline truly makes the virtual part way worse than it has to be, and they clearly haven‚Äôt adapted their platform based on everything that was said after NAACL and ACL. I doubt they will now. Given that this is a computer science-ish field with tons of money, do we really have to inflict this on ourselves?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;location&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A completely orthogonal dimension to the hybrid format and Underline is the location. Which in this case was Punta Cana, Dominican republic. Which looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/punta-cana.jpeg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt get me wrong: the Caribbean is magical. I would probably never have made it without this conference, I‚Äôll remember it forever, and I‚Äôm happy I was able to go. I wish everybody else could have seen the palm trees, the sunrise on the beach, the parrots, and everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, if I were to design a special hell for an academic - I‚Äôd give them a limited time in a tropical beach with turtles to snorkel with, a buffet with infinite supply of mango smoothies‚Ä¶ and a deadline to watch a bunch of talks, or write a grant application, or something like that. In this setup you get tortured by FOMO no matter what you choose to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also try to compromise, which will probably result in doing a bad job of both options. I honestly tried the student solution of just not sleeping. I lived on 6 hours of sleep for a week to go for a swim before the conference - and I normally need 8-9 hours. Result: still foggy and exhausted, 3 days after I‚Äôm back. I‚Äôm sure the quality of my thinking suffered, and I rambled incoherently to people who deserved better. It also feels profoundly wrong to be at a resort, where everybody relaxes, but you are running between things like it‚Äôs the start of the term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kudos for an ingenious solution to Marzena Karpinska, who risked her phone and headphones and literally watched the crowdsourcing tutorial &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the pool. Wish someone made waterproof laptops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So‚Ä¶ if we do have any more conferences in tropical resorts, I‚Äôd suggest to make them at least 2 weeks long, with half a day dedicated to snorkeling, birding, kayaking and everything else that has blissfully nothing to do with research, but is a sin to miss. I can even nominate special chairs for all that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I didn‚Äôt expect, but totally should have: there were almost no power outlets, and wifi was patchy and unreliable (probably depending on how many tourists were streaming movies at a given time). Kind of duh, this place is emphatically not meant for work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again: EMNLP 2021 was certainly unforgettable, and I‚Äôm very happy and priviledged to be able to attend it. And the organizers put an insane amount of volunteer work into getting the first hybrid conference to run as smoothly as possible. There is certainly a lot of valuable experience here for future events, as well as plenty of food for thought.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Anna Rogers</name></author><category term="howto" /><category term="academia" /><category term="organization" /><category term="conference" /><summary type="html">Field notes from EMNLP 2021, the first hybrid *ACL conference.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How to Record a Virtual Conference Talk</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2021/recording/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to Record a Virtual Conference Talk" /><published>2021-05-08T01:00:47-04:00</published><updated>2021-05-08T01:00:47-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2021/recording</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2021/recording/">&lt;p&gt;Virtual talks have been the bliss and the curse of NLP virtual conferences. Because of the efforts to preserve them and link them up to the paper pages in ACL anthology, they are the bliss for the audience, and greatly improve conference accessibility worldwide. But for the authors they are the curse: because they are pre-recorded, there is an expectation of some degree of polish on the talk, and so the perfectionists may take way more time to prepare and record than just doing the talk live. Also, few of us have a stylish home office to show off, and even fewer majored in film making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An extra level of complexity is added by the fact that different conferences contract different platforms who host the videos for the duration of the conference, and those platforms may offer more or less convenient recorder software (not to mention the licensing nightmare, which I‚Äôll skip for now). They may also have some format quirks. So far the virtual conferences I attended used either &lt;a href=&quot;https://underline.io&quot;&gt;Underline&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://slideslive.com&quot;&gt;Slideslive&lt;/a&gt;. The former shows regular single-video presentations, while the latter actually has &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; video streams: the speaker view and the slidesview, the latter usable for navigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these platforms has their pros and cons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the current slideslive editor lacks basic things like removing, copying and pasting parts of the video. They are going to release a new version soon, which I got to preview, and which is much better - but it is still a browser-based solution, which offers cross-platform accessibility but not well equipped for either video editing or full access to camera/audio settings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Underline offers screen-cast-o-matic recorder and editor. The recorder has a desktop ‚Äúinstaller‚Äù, but seems to be still fundamentally web-based and not giving you much control over the camera &amp;amp; mike. They also do not support Linux.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These, and any other platform-specific setups also have the inherent disadvantage that their full functionality is only available while the conference is paying. Since we have to learn how to use &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; recording/editing tools - wouldn‚Äôt it be better to learn tools we could use at any time (for an invited talk, a lecture, a podcast, etc.)? Also, maybe we could save some money on the services we have to hire, and make conference registrations cheaper?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs my DYI setup for recording talks that can be then uploaded to single or double-view players (vimeo, slideslive, underline, younameit). It is possible to get a nice recording entirely with open-source software. It‚Äôs not harder than an average PyTorch tutorial, and with addition of some commercial software, you can also get the correct captions &lt;em&gt;at the same time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-0-equipment&quot;&gt;Step 0: equipment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal setup:&lt;/strong&gt; you need a camera and a microphone, and obviously a computer where the presentation will run. The built-in webcam and microphone &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; do, depending on what they are and how picky you are. Your headphones might also have a built-in mike (although I was severely disappointed with my Sony WH-1000XM3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My fancy setup:&lt;/strong&gt; I used to be a musician in my previous life, so I‚Äôm quite picky about sound. The bottom line with mikes is that you want them to be reasonable quality, in a quiet environment, close to the source of sound (your mouth) and not moving around (as that will create different volume levels). The latter can be achieved either by fixing the mike on yourself (lavalier mikes, headset mikes), or fixing both the mike and yourself (having the mike on the desk or a stand, and not moving).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caveat: most laptops do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; even have a dedicated mike input, even if you have a good mike. In that situation you probably need a USB mike, which essentially works as an external sound card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, I already was in possession of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zoom.co.jp/products/handy-recorder/h1-handy-recorder&quot;&gt;Zoom H1&lt;/a&gt; recorder which does also work as an external sound card. I could use just the mikes on that recorder, but it also has a separate mike input, which I used for my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rode.com/microphones/lavaliergo&quot;&gt;R√∏de lavalier Go&lt;/a&gt; (which I love dearly).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/recording_equipment.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the video equipment, I‚Äôm really not an expert, but it seems that what matters even more than the camera is the lighting: you need the light on your face to be bright enough and uniform enough, or you‚Äôll get a video that is dark and with unflattering shadows. Depending on your environment, you might be able to just use daylight. The professional setups seem to involve at least two directed lights on both sides of the face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is hard on the eyes, so when recording my EACL 2021 tutorial I put the laptop and all the gear on the window sill (with two more windows on either side providing side lighting), so as to face the soft daylight. I had a high-res webcam with autofocus (Logitech HD 1080p), and I thought I could trust it to stay on my face. I was wrong: the light afforded by a cloudy evening in Copenhagen does not suffice. My video ended up quite blurry, and I suspect the autofocus actually made things worse. Proceed with caution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to remove the background on your speaker view, or replace it with a cool Martian landscape, you will also need something usable as a backdrop: a large piece of solid-colored and smooth fabric (ideally green), and some way to make it hang smoothly behind your chair. Some recorders (such as the one built in Zoom) may have their own filters, which will do a better or worse job of removing your background - but a backdrop will dramatically increase their chances too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-recording&quot;&gt;Step 1: Recording&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software you‚Äôll need:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://obsproject.com/&quot;&gt;OBS Studio&lt;/a&gt; (Windows, Linux, Mac)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a free, open source, and extremely feature-rich recorder which can do a lot more than we need. I feel quite intimidated by all the settings it has, but luckily we don‚Äôt need all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs the OBS interface. We need to understand two sections: canvas and sources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/obs-annotated2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you run OBS Studio for the first time, it may ask you whether you want to optimize for streaming or recording (choose recording), and for the video settings. Choose 30 FPS and 1920x1080 resolution, if available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;single-screen-recording&quot;&gt;Single-screen recording&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm going to assume that the target resolution requested by the hosting platform is fullHD 1920x1080 (if not, adjust the instructions accordingly).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Video and set the base canvas resolution to &lt;strong&gt;1920 x 1080&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the main window, click on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; button under &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Sources&lt;/code&gt;. For a screencast recording you will need at least 2 sources: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Audio Input Capture&lt;/code&gt; (mike) and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Window Capture&lt;/code&gt; (slides). Set your input devices and slides window in the properties for these inputs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optional: add the speaker view.&lt;/em&gt; The above screenshot shows the speaker view on the side of the slides. To create that, prepare slides that are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; 16:9 aspect (mine were 4:3), and then add one more input source: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Video Input Capture&lt;/code&gt; (webcam). Place it within the canvas, to the left/right side of your slides view. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Optional, advanced: Crop the camera view.&lt;/em&gt; Most webcams default to 16:9 aspect ratio, and most of us are not bodybuilders and do not need it to be so wide. So we can crop the webcam view to get it closer to portrait aspect, and have a larger view of the face. Select the webcam view on the canvas, go to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Transform&lt;/code&gt; in its context menu, and experiment with how many pixels you want cropped from any side of the camera view. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Optional, also advanced: remove the view of your bedroom.&lt;/em&gt; If you have something usable as solid color backdrop (ideally green), position it behind you and go to the context menu of the webcam input source. Go to the context menu on the webcam input, find &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Filters&lt;/code&gt;, press the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; button in the bottom left corner. Add the filter called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Chroma key&lt;/code&gt;. In its settings, select the key color type of your backdrop and play with the ‚Äúsimilarity‚Äù slider until it removes the background and nothing else. Then you can even make the speaker view &lt;em&gt;overlay&lt;/em&gt; the slides like this:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/obs-overlay.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even more advanced: replace the view of your bedroom.&lt;/em&gt; You can add a Martian landscape or whatever as your background. Add one more source of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/code&gt; type. Choose the image you like in the properties of that source. Position it on the canvas so that it is behind your webcam view (Context menu of the object on the canvas &amp;gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Order&lt;/code&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Move up/down&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Optional: add any other filters on your sources that you like and know how to use (context menu on an input &amp;gt; Filters &amp;gt; ‚Äú+‚Äù button in the bottom left corner). I always use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Noise suppression&lt;/code&gt; filter on the Audio Input (with RNNoise setting): it decreases the background noise caught by the mike from any humming in the room (fridges, computer fans etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Settings&lt;/code&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Hotkeys&lt;/code&gt; for the actions of ‚Äúrecording‚Äù and ‚Äústop recording‚Äù. I have them both at &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ctrl+R&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Test the whole workflow: start the recording, switch to your slides, do a test slide, stop the recording. OBS Studio simply saves the video file to the location specified in Settings &amp;gt; Output. I save in mp4 format, at ‚Äúhigh quality, medium file size‚Äù setting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Record the talk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two-screen-recording-for-slideslive&quot;&gt;Two-screen recording (for slideslive)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slideslive is great in giving us the separate views of speakers and slides, but the disadvantage is that, obviously, you have to record &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; videos instead of one, and keep them in sync. Most recorders can‚Äôt do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick to achieve this in OBS Studio is to record a single ultra-wide video that combines both views, and then to split it into two. So the source video would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/double-video.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs how to make such a recording:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Video and set the base canvas resolution to 3840 x 1080. That will give us room for two 1920x1080 views side-by-side.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create speaker and slides views as described above, with any filters you like. Move and resize the webcam view and slides view on the canvas until they are perfectly side-by-side.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Record the talk as described above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2-editing-the-recording&quot;&gt;Step 2: Editing the recording&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minimalist setup&lt;/em&gt;: All we need is a video editor with three barebone functions: cut, paste, and crop. &lt;a href=&quot;https://shotcut.org/download/&quot;&gt;Shotcut&lt;/a&gt; is open-source and cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac). Maybe there are even better options (feel free to add suggestions in the comments).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To edit with Shotcut:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Import your video file (with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Open File&lt;/code&gt; in the panel) and add it to the timeline using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; button.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do any editing you need, using the timeline for navigation. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Space&lt;/code&gt; will play the video, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; or the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;][&lt;/code&gt; button will create a split point. If there‚Äôs a part of video you‚Äôd like to remove, create split points in its beginning and its end and remove it from the context menu on the undesirable part of the video (or use  the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; shortcut). You can also cut a part of the video this way and paste it to some other split point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The editor looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/shotcut.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Delux setup&lt;/em&gt;. I am absolutely in love with &lt;a href=&quot;https://descript.com&quot;&gt;Descript&lt;/a&gt;. It is also a video/audio editor, but it is aimed at people producing podcasts and vlogs, i.e. the use case where the primary concern is not just the visuals, but what is being said. Here‚Äôs what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/descript.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Descript does is magic. It makes a transcription of the talk, and then lets you edit the video based on that transcript. Which means - no more rewinding several times to try to find the exact moment of the split. This is lightning fast. You read the transcript, you see the part you don‚Äôt like, you select the text corresponding to that part and you delete it, just like in a text processor. And the video is adjusted and re-synced automatically. It even has the handy feature of automatically detecting and removing all the ‚Äúuhs‚Äù! And it can normalize the volume of the audio, in case it turned out to be uneven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The con is that it is not free, but (at least in my case) it definitely saves more time then it costs. The mid-tier version costs $12 a month and lets you transcribe 10 hours of video. The $24 top-tier version gives you 30 hours. There is a free tier with 3 hours of transcription, but it caps the resolution at 720p and adds a watermark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, beware that very fine-grained video editing does make the speaker view video look a bit bumpy. If you try to stitch a sentence together using several separate segments ‚Äì it will probably look unnatural. I think it is a lesser evil than making people listen to something wrong or full of ‚Äúuhs‚Äù, but a simple strategy to avoid too fine-grained editing is to simply do the tricky part again, without breaking your recording. Let‚Äôs say you end up with several consecutive takes of a difficult slide, with various degrees of rambling. When you edit in Descript, you see the text you‚Äôre saying, so it‚Äôs easy to simply pick the better version and delete the others. The longer segments you get without editing, the more natural the video will look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use Descript:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add your video file&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Auto-transcribe it (will take a couple of minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Edit the text as desired. The deleted parts of video will be auto-removed accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Export the video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side note: Descript has an interesting security solution. The pro version has the uncanny ability to train a model of your voice, and overdub the parts you wish you said differently (audio only at this point). Which is great for the presenters, but obviously is a security risk, because with enough recordings people could deepfake somebody else‚Äôs voice. Well, in Descript they can‚Äôt do that: to train the model, you have to record a fairly long specific text, so the victim would have to be tricked into reading it aloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3-splitting-the-recording-only-for-slideslive&quot;&gt;Step 3: Splitting the recording (only for slideslive)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However you did the editing, the result is a cleaned-up version of the original video file. If you made an ultra-wide video intended for slideslive, we also need to split it into &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; files that slideslive can import.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Shotcut, add a crop filter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;click on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Filters&lt;/code&gt; in the top panel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Filter panel will appear on the left. Click &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, open the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/code&gt; tab, and select &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Crop rectangle&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set the crop filter so as to remove the right part of your video. At this point we have a 3840 x 1080 video, and we need two 1920 x 1080 videos. Set the dimensions of crop for 1920x1080, and the position to 0,0. This will remove the right-hand side of the video.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Export the edited video (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;File &amp;gt; Export Video&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeat steps 3 and 4 to export the right-hand side of the video (with the same crop dimensions, but position 1920,0).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-4-subtitles-optional&quot;&gt;Step 4: Subtitles (optional)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subtitles are a great way to increase accessibility of our videos, but all the specialized terminology + many non-native speakers = captioning disaster. Which is kinda ironic, given that the field is NLP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video recording platforms may offer a subtitle editor, but I haven‚Äôt seen anyone singing praise for them so far. The ones I tried are lacking in the keyboard navigation, which makes the process slower. Also the process is inherently frustrating, at least for me: by the time we get to subtitles we‚Äôve already spent too much time trying to record and edit the video, and subtitles are the last hurdle that (a) is a lot of work, (b) not fun, because who likes looking at our own very imperfect videos?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be possible to do the subtitles elsewhere and then import them to the platform. Slideslive subtitles editor can import subtitles in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.vtt&lt;/code&gt; format: there is no upload link immediately when you upload the videos, but once they generate their own version of the subtitles, they will send you a link to the subtitle editor. There will be an ‚Äúimport‚Äù button there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you remember your talk well, the fastest, minimal-effort thing is probably to just download the auto-generated subtitle file from the editor, and do the obvious edits in any text editor. If you need the video to help with the editing, try some other subtitles editor that can work with the given format. A quick search for open-source tools locates &lt;a href=&quot;https://nikse.dk/SubtitleEdit/&quot;&gt;Subtitle Edit&lt;/a&gt; (Windows, Linux) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://nikse.dk/SubtitleEdit/Online&quot;&gt;its online version that works with local video files&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, I gave up and just paid Descript to be able to edit my video based on text, because then I get exportable transcript/subtitles already as a by-product of video editing. Since the whole editing process is based on text, you can not only remove any bits you don‚Äôt like, but also fix any auto-transcription errors as you go. And then &lt;em&gt;you get both the video and the subtitles at the same time&lt;/em&gt;! So - full accessibility with as little work as I can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One slideslive-specific caveat is that the file exported by Descript has extra metadata not conforming to the vtt format (lines 3-5). Once those lines are removed, the subtitles can be imported to slideslive. I was told that the editor will be improved to handle this automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-5-thats-it&quot;&gt;Step 5: That‚Äôs it!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this worked, and you now have a nice talk recorded in reasonable time. If you have any suggestions for alternatives for the software/hardware I used, or a good lighting solution, or any updates because of changes in any software, please share in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Anna Rogers</name></author><category term="howto" /><category term="academia" /><category term="productivity" /><summary type="html">Yes, it is possible to record and edit a conference talk at home, with open-source tools in reasonable time.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Should the reviewers know who the authors are?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/anonymity/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Should the reviewers know who the authors are?" /><published>2020-07-15T01:00:47-04:00</published><updated>2020-07-15T01:00:47-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/anonymity</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/anonymity/">&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This post is my $0.02 in the ongoing debate about ACL peer review reform. TLDR if you‚Äôve missed that: ACL is discussing the ways to improve peer review, and released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Short-Term_Reform_Proposals_for_ACL_Reviewing&quot;&gt;short-term&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Rolling_Review_Proposal&quot;&gt;long-term&lt;/a&gt; review proposals that generated many lively discussions on Twitter and in ACL 2020. The debate is still going on, and ACL actively solicited community feedback. So far the proposals focused on new workflows and efficiency of the process; I‚Äôm arguing for broadening the goals so as to also improve author anonymity ‚Äì all the way up to the best paper award committees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-peer-review-needs-to-be-fully-anonymous&quot;&gt;Why peer review needs to be fully anonymous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a truth universally acknowledged that when the reviewers aware of the identity of the authors, they are strongly biased towards established authors and famous labs &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#TomkinsZhangEtAl_2017_Reviewer_bias_in_single-_versus_double-blind_peer_review&quot;&gt;(Tomkins, Zhang, &amp;amp; Heavlin, 2017)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, well, at least it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be a truth universally acknowledged. One of the most famous experiments on this was done nearly 30 years ago &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#PetersCeci_1982_fate_of_published_articles_submitted_again&quot;&gt;(Peters &amp;amp; Ceci, 1982)&lt;/a&gt;. They resubmitted 12 articles to reputable psychology journals that already &lt;em&gt;published&lt;/em&gt; these very same articles - but they changed the authors‚Äô names and institutions changed to unknown names. Only 8% of editors and reviewers noticed the resubmisson, and 89% recommended rejection, in many cases for ‚Äòmethodology flaws‚Äô!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this was 30 years ago, before we had Twitter and blogs. The research community has since made a lot of progress in developing ‚ÄòPR review‚Äô techniques: a famous lab can have a specific preprint widely discussed before it is even submitted for review. That wide discussion by itself creates the impression that the community already accepted and validated this work, and so of course the reviewers should recommend it for acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs not even the worst part. It is a truth less universally acknowledged that non-anonymous peer review, like any other non-anonymous human interaction, is at risk of being compromised by social biases, such as biases by race, gender, ethnicity, age group. There is more than enough evidence to be concerned &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#BornmannMutzEtAl_2007_Gender_differences_in_grant_peer_review_meta-analysis&quot;&gt;(Bornmann, Mutz, &amp;amp; Daniel, 2007; Kaatz, Gutierrez, &amp;amp; Carnes, 2014; Hojat, Gonnella, &amp;amp; Caelleigh, 2003)&lt;/a&gt;, and to do something while we‚Äôre educating ourselves on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key point here is that this applies even when the biases are unconscious. Say, we may be absolutely sure that neither the race of the authors, nor the prestige of their institution has anything to do with our opinion of a paper. The problem is that our conscious selves are not really trustworthy. So, given human cognitive limitations, the best thing we can do is a fully anonymous peer-review process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;isnt-it-fully-anonymous-already&quot;&gt;Isn‚Äôt it fully anonymous already?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, isn‚Äôt NLP peer review already fully anonymous? Yes and no. *CL conferences officially implement a fully anonymous peer review process, and require the authors to avoid revealing self-citations. However‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;arxiv-and-anonymity-period&quot;&gt;ArXiv and anonymity period&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there‚Äôs this thing called arXiv. The authors are not prohibited from uploading and publicizing their work &lt;a href=&quot;https://acl2020.org/calls/papers/#important-anonymity-period&quot;&gt;a month before submission deadline&lt;/a&gt;; this seems to mostly have the effect of shifting the deadline a month earlier. Note that the big labs with more resources and projects are more likely to have at least some of the drafts relatively finished and arXiv-ed before the anonymity period kicks in, and so they are more likely to have at least some papers accepted each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not aware of any studies done for *CL conferences (presumably because their peer review data is not available for public analysis) - but ICLR review scores do correlate with arXiv preprint availability &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#BharadhwajTurpinEtAl_2020_De-anonymization_of_authors_through_arXiv_submissions_during_double-blind_review&quot;&gt;(Bharadhwaj, Turpin, Garg, &amp;amp; Anderson, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;. The effect is particularly noticeable for less confident reviewers who seem to rely more on author reputation (estimated by Google Scholar citation data):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iclr-acceptance.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would speculate that the effect is particularly large for papers by big labs that managed to attract a lot of attention (especially big industry labs with considerable PR resources). Arguably Google AI‚Äôs BERT &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#DevlinChangEtAl_2019_BERT_Pre-training_of_Deep_Bidirectional_Transformers_for_Language_Understanding&quot;&gt;(Devlin, Chang, Lee, &amp;amp; Toutanova, 2019)&lt;/a&gt; entirely circumvented the peer review process because the paper was already famous and widely cited by the time it got to NAACL. It is &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@ryancotterell/we-should-anonymize-model-names-during-peer-review-bcab0cc78946&quot;&gt;highly unlikely that it could be reviewed anonymously&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should BERT have gotten the best paper award? Quite possibly, but perhaps we should think through the whole issue of ‚Äúpeer review‚Äù vs ‚ÄúPR review‚Äù. When something gets so much attention, it just &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; highly important, and the reviewers can hardly be expected to be immune to that. If we do accept hype as a valid indicator of scientific merit, we should at least recognize that it is a distinct factor. ‚ÄúPR-reviewed‚Äù papers should not compete for conference acceptance and awards with papers that went through peer review anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;anonymity-and-acceptance-decisions&quot;&gt;Anonymity and acceptance decisions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the reviewers have not seen the preprint, they are not the ones who are actually making any acceptance decisions. Area chairs (ACs), senior area chairs (SACs) and program chairs (PCs) &lt;em&gt;may or may not be aware of the identity of the authors&lt;/em&gt;; this is up to the conference, and is not announced in capital letters on the conference home page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us note that the ACs and SACs are themselves likely to be senior members of NLP community. As such, they are likely to be well-connected and know much of the work that they evaluate. Even if nobody consciously favors their friends or disfavors any particular social group ‚Äì the biases are biases precisely because they are unconscious and humans can‚Äôt control them very well. Furthermore, speaking for myself, I suspect that when I happen to know the authors and the whole line of work they are pursuing, I may be seeing a bigger pattern than what was clearly spelled out in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, consider the conference awards. The starting point for those is recommendations by reviewers, who may or may not know who the authors are because of arXiv, but what happens from that point on is equally at the discretion of the conference. COLING 2018 did maintain anonymity even at this stage, but let us take &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yoavgo/status/1278468990730412033?s=20&quot;&gt;Yoav Goldberg‚Äôs word&lt;/a&gt; that usually this is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;arguments-against-anonymity&quot;&gt;Arguments against anonymity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, at the moment *CL reviewing is at best only partially anonymous. But is this necessarily a bad thing? To be fair, let us hear the counter-arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;big-labs-just-do-better-work&quot;&gt;‚ÄúBig labs just do better work‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an argument against trying to correct for bias towards big names. The main point is that the quality of the work could be expected to genuinely correlate with the status of a research group. Say, Stanford remains Stanford because it systematically attracts smarter people who are likely to produce superior output. In that case, since peer review is genuinely noisy and difficult, witholding this information from reviewers means witholding a useful signal &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Church_2020_Emerging_trends_Reviewing_reviewers_again&quot;&gt;(Church, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The counter-argument is that the fame of a big lab may also have a halo effect on a mediocre paper. Everything just looks more trustworthy when it comes from e.g. Harvard - especially in comparison to a paper of similar quality, but by unknown authors. Furthermore, it‚Äôs one thing when the fame of a research group rests primarily on its past achievements and reputation, and another when the group itself is new, but gets more favorable treatment simply due to its affiliation and their PR resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Church argues that the solution to that is ‚Äúseniority quotas‚Äù, where the conference makes a conscious decision to give that much floor to established and up-and-coming labs. My concern here is that we also have the cross-cutting biases for trendy topics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackingsemantics.xyz/2020/reviewing-data/&quot;&gt;deep-learning-based methodology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackingsemantics.xyz/2020/reviewing-models&quot;&gt;SOTA results&lt;/a&gt; and many more. These probably can‚Äôt be addressed in any other way than by acceptance quotas, while the author fame bias &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be handled by fully anonymous review process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-difference-will-it-make&quot;&gt;‚ÄúWhat difference will it make?‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other argument is that it is not clear that fully anonymous review actually improves the quality of the resulting program - but there is plenty of evidence of it failing to weed out bad papers, even in biomedical research where lives literally depend on it &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Smith_2010_Classical_peer_review_empty_gun&quot;&gt;(Smith, 2010)&lt;/a&gt;. So if it doesn‚Äôt do what we want it to do, should we even bother? Kenneth Church argues that it is up to the side arguing for anonymity to provide a proof that it increases not only fairness, but also quality:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Obviously, we care about more than just fairness. Experiments supporting double-blind reviewing need to establish that the treatment (double-blind reviewing) is not only more fair than the control (traditional reviewing) but also more effective. Does the treatment accept better papers (with more potential for growth) than the control, or is treatment merely more random than the control? Thus far, most experiments (Tomkins, Zhang, and Heavlin 2017; Stelmakh, Shah, and Singh 2019) have more to say about fairness than effectiveness. &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Church_2020_Emerging_trends_Reviewing_reviewers_again&quot;&gt;(Church, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fully agree that the overall goal is to find papers with more scientific merit - but we can‚Äôt really measure that reliably, we seem to only agree on which papers are clearly bad (see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.mrtz.org/2014/12/15/the-nips-experiment.html&quot;&gt;NIPS experiment&lt;/a&gt;). But theoretically, if we accept that different demographic groups have approximately the same distribution of quality papers, then removing those biases would &lt;em&gt;improve&lt;/em&gt; the overall quality of the program. For instance, if male and female first authors have the same ratio of high-quality papers, but the papers by women get systematically under-sampled - that means accepting more papers by men, even when they are in fact inferior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we just use post-publication citation counts as proxy for paper merit, to prove that anonymity does or does not improve the overall program quality? Not really. For a paper to have high impact and ‚Äúpotential for growth‚Äù, it needs (a) that there‚Äôs room for building on its ideas, (b) that the community would do so. And that second part depends on more than just science. Consider at least the following factors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Matthew effect: the already-eminent scientists get disproportionate credit in cases of collaboration, or when the same discovery is made by independent teams &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Merton_1968_Matthew_Effect_in_Science_reward_and_communication_systems_of_science_are_considered&quot;&gt;(Merton, 1968)&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Post-publication PR, which is also easier for the big labs that have more resources to write blog posts and travel to give talks. They also receive many more  invitations to participate in panels and give talks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How papers are received post-publication is still at least partly influenced by the same unconscious biases discussed above. Campaigns like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?button_hashtag=CiteBlackWomen&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; class=&quot;twitter-hashtag-button&quot; data-show-count=&quot;false&quot;&gt;#CiteBlackWomen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; are a response to an unfortunate reality. And here‚Äôs a recent bit of evidence very close to home: preliminary analysis by Yoav Goldberg suggests that the talks by the authors with Chinese-sounding names &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yoavgo/status/1282700056211202049?s=20&quot;&gt;were viewed less often&lt;/a&gt; in the online ACL 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of that means that even if a great idea from an unknown lab and/or underrepresented community gets published at ACL, it might not make as big a splash as it deserves. That means that fewer people will adopt and build upon its results. Hence the ‚Äúpotential for growth‚Äù was never going to be the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, we do not know exactly how full anonymity would change our conference programs, but here‚Äôs what we do know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When ICLR went fully anonymous, we had a natural experiment which showed that preprints do make a difference; so we do know for a fact that the content of the program &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; change to some extent &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#BharadhwajTurpinEtAl_2020_De-anonymization_of_authors_through_arXiv_submissions_during_double-blind_review&quot;&gt;(Bharadhwaj, Turpin, Garg, &amp;amp; Anderson, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The bias against underrepresented communities should be reduced. For instance, there is evidence that when author identity is concealed female first authors get a better chance &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#RobertsVerhoef_2016_Double-blind_reviewing_at_EvoLang_11_reveals_gender_bias&quot;&gt;(Roberts &amp;amp; Verhoef, 2016)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even if this does increase randomness in peer review, as Kenneth Church predicts, that might actually be a good thing for progress &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#PluchinoBiondoEtAl_2018_Talent_versus_luck_role_of_randomness_in_success_and_failure&quot;&gt;(Pluchino, Biondo, &amp;amp; Rapisarda, 2018)&lt;/a&gt;: among other things, their model suggests that it would be more effective to award some research funding randomly, rather than preferentially targeting established researchers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a more inclusive process should be beneficial for geographic diversity. In case of NLP, that should propel language inclusivity, which is not great at the moment &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#JoshiSantyEtAl_2020_State_and_Fate_of_Linguistic_Diversity_and_Inclusion_in_NLP_World&quot;&gt;(Joshi, Santy, Budhiraja, Bali, &amp;amp; Choudhury, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;. Studying ‚Äúlanguages‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúEnglish‚Äù would certainly be helpful for the goal of modeling ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù. Furthermore, this should improve the flow of ideas and collaborations between subcommunities, and there‚Äôs evidence that ‚Äúethnically diverse‚Äù papers have a larger impact &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#AlShebliRahwanEtAl_2018_preeminence_of_ethnic_diversity_in_scientific_collaboration&quot;&gt;(AlShebli, Rahwan, &amp;amp; Woon, 2018)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judging by the overall direction of ACL 2020, and the presence of diversity&amp;amp;inclusion chairs in the recent conferences, the ACL organization now does aim to improve diversity, and full anonymity would be helpful for that. I hope that as the social movement towards diversity&amp;amp;inclusion grows, the community would also gradually become more interested in picking up and developing non-mainstream ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;small-labs-need-arxiv&quot;&gt;‚ÄúSmall labs need arXiv‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ArXiv preprints are vigorously defended by Dmytro Mishkin and Amy Tabb in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amytabb.com/ts/2020_06_29/&quot;&gt;‚ÄúHands off ArXiv!‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, they make the following two arguments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;even without preprints, the big labs will still find it easier to get published than small labs, because they have more resources and more experienced writers. For the small labs arXiv is a lifeline because it enables them to generate &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; discussion;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;early career researchers need preprints to have &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; on their CVs when they apply for jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter point could actually be solved within an anonymous preprint system: for example, upon submission of a manuscript people could get receipts acknowledging the submission, and those receipts and/or pdfs stamped with submission record information could be provided as part of the application package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the former, it is true that scales are tipped in favor of big labs to begin with. Allen Schmaltz &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/allenschmaltz/Resolute_Resolutions/blob/master/volume1/volume1.pdf&quot;&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; that even an anonymous author may be at disadvantage not because the reviewers can guess who they are, but rather who they are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; (a member of an established lab with resources and recognizable research agenda). But it is hardly a reason to not to try to &lt;em&gt;reduce&lt;/em&gt; systemic biases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a case study, one of the inherent disadvantages for most small labs in the world is that the famous big labs tend to be based in the English-speaking countries. Non-native-sounding English nearly got one of EMNLP PC committees to reject &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; their submissions from Asian and European countries with less than 5 submissions &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Church_2020_Emerging_trends_Reviewing_reviewers_again&quot;&gt;(Church, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;! However, this factor is increasingly recognized, and there are initiatives to try to mitigate it. For instance, ACL Student Research Workshop is already running a &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/acl20studentresearchworkshop/mentoring&quot;&gt;mentoring program&lt;/a&gt; specifically to improve the quality of writing and presentation. ACL 2020 also had sponsorship from Grammarly to help with proof-reading. &lt;a href=&quot;https://2020.emnlp.org/blog/2020-05-17-write-good-reviews/&quot;&gt;EMNLP 2020 reviewing guidelines&lt;/a&gt; specifically ask the reviewers to focus on the paper substance, not the writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue, of course, is that early-career researchers do depend vitally on their work being openly available and discussed. I fully agree with that. But it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; impossible to combine that with fully anonymous peer review. Specifically, we need to (a) speed up the review process, (b) develop a culture for discussing anonymous work. I will describe a proposal for how both of these goals could be achieved below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;arxiv-is-all-we-need&quot;&gt;‚ÄúArXiv is all we need‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard this last argument many times over the discussion of rolling review proposals. Yes, peer review by itself is deeply problematic. Again, it fails to detect serious flaws &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Smith_2010_Classical_peer_review_empty_gun&quot;&gt;(Smith, 2010)&lt;/a&gt;, it is essentially &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.mrtz.org/2014/12/15/the-nips-experiment.html&quot;&gt;random for papers that are not obviously bad&lt;/a&gt;, and it does not necessarily reward great contributions: a recent NLP example is ELMO, that had unenthusiastic reviews at ICLR and then went to take the best paper award at NAACL. So‚Ä¶ maybe we don‚Äôt need to bother with review at all, anonymous or not? Shall we just embrace preprints and let citation counts be the indicators of the paper quality?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, this is simply not realistic, because academic careers depend on the prestige of publication venues. This is why top-tier conferences also cannot just start accepting more than 25% of papers. Yes, this is arbitrary and has nothing to do with research, but I have not seen any sufficiently detailed alternative proposals. And even if someone came up with one, it would take many years of lobbying universities and research councils to accept it. And it would have to be done by the senior academics who have many other demands on their time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, that is actually not an argument against full anonymity, but against peer review as such. As discussed above, having the crowd ‚Äúvote‚Äù on preprints with citations will suffer from all the same biases: less famous labs and/or authors from marginalized communities are less likely to have their papers noticed organically and/or have the resources to promote them, which will have an impact on the citation count distribution. ‚ÄúPR review‚Äù might completely overtake ‚Äúpeer review‚Äù. On the other hand, taking full anonymity seriously in peer review and developing a culture of discussing anonymous preprints has a chance of developing a healthier research ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;acl-rolling-review-proposals&quot;&gt;ACL rolling review proposal(s)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what can we actually do about all this? Luckily, the arbitrariness of peer review in the recent years and the increasing review load has already led the community to believe that &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; should be done. ACL already came forward with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Rolling_Review_Proposal&quot;&gt;long-term review reform proposal&lt;/a&gt;. This post is inspired by numerous conversations around this proposal on Twitter and during ACL 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current version of the rolling review proposal maintains the status quo with respect to anonymity, considering it a separate issue to be addressed later. In this post, I argue that we do need to think of it already to make sure that the new system at least can be more fair than what we have. True, we can‚Äôt hope to solve every issue at once, but this one is really big, especially given the raising awareness of societal biases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, here is the current version of this proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;option-1-review-then-accept&quot;&gt;Option 1: review, then accept&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To decrease the volume of papers that get (re-)reviewed, ACL is proposing to switch to a journal-like rolling review process with two stages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 1&lt;/strong&gt;: papers are submitted to a unified review pool with monthly deadlines, where they undergo fully anonymous peer review. After that is done, the authors have the option to revise-and-resubmit, or they may choose to make their papers public.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 2&lt;/strong&gt;: authors of already-reviewed papers may submit their work to conferences/workshops/journals (based on their respective deadlines). The ACs/SACs/PCs make decisions based on the existing reviews, and their own editorial policies. This process may or may not conceal author identity, like it is done today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;option-2-reviewaccept&quot;&gt;Option 2: review+accept&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation of the rolling review proposal in ACL 2020 was followed by a very lively RocketChat discussion, in which &lt;a href=&quot;https://matt-gardner.github.io/&quot;&gt;Matt Gardner&lt;/a&gt; mentioned an alternative proposal that the review committee also considered, but it didn‚Äôt make it past the brain-storming stage. The idea is basically &lt;em&gt;‚Äúreview+accept‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;: the journal/conference acceptance decisions would be made inside of the rolling review system, thus maintaining full anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;: not only full anonymity, but also much faster turnaround!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;: So far the acceptance rates were stable at around 25%, but offline conferences have an extra constraint of the venue space. For instance, if next year we still have room for only 800 papers, but receive over 6000 submissions, we will either have to lower the acceptance rate, or have conferences that are 90% posters, or stick to online conferences. This is a separate issue, but if ACL were to decide to address this by lowering the acceptance rates, it would be harder to do in the &lt;em&gt;review+accept&lt;/em&gt; version because the organizers wouldn‚Äôt get all the papers at once. Say, a CFP could be announced to run for 4 months, but already in the first month the PCs might accept the maximum number of papers they can for a given physical venue, and stop receiving submissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the issue of scaling our conferences is a separate one, and deserves serious consideration. At the moment, it is not clear whether the pros of offline conferences outweigh the environmental and social costs. But if ACL does not opt to cap the total number of accepted papers, &lt;em&gt;‚Äúreview+accept‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; would deliver acceptance decisions would arrive a month or two faster than in &lt;em&gt;‚Äúreview, then accept‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;. This is significant in the fast-moving world of current NLP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;### Embracing anonymous preprints&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In either proposal, the key issue for anonymity is what happens after a paper was reviewed, and before it is submitted for a conference. Suppose the authors aim for ACL, and their paper is submitted for review in August. They have to wait until the ACL CFP is out (or submit to some other venue). Let‚Äôs say the paper is reviewed in September and the authors are happy with the reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they choose to deanonymize, there is the immediate benefit of having a ‚Äúrespectable‚Äù peer-reviewed preprint under their names, which is important for those on the job market. But there are two big problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many papers do not get accepted on the first try. The authors may try a conference and then decide to make changes and go back into the reviewing pool. If they do so, the peer review will no longer be anonymous.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The conference acceptance decisions would inherently be partly or fully non-anonymous. As Yoav Goldberg pointed out, in this proposed scheme the situation would actually be worse than it is now, because the editorial role of ACs/SACs/PCs really puts them in the limelight, and &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; identities will be known to the authors. In other words, the authors will know that it is these specific people that did not want their work in the conference, perhaps despite good reviews. And who wants to make enemies?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;btw, it goes both ways: as a SAC/PC in the new system, the authors will know that *you*, *personally* did not find their paper suitable for ACL 2023. this may cause some tricky situations (and all the more incentives for SAC/PC to get papers from influentials/friends in)&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; (((ŸÑ()(ŸÑ() &amp;#39;yoav)))) (@yoavgo) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yoavgo/status/1274673040782233600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 21, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we just hide the identities of the editors, so they don‚Äôt have to fear retaliation? No, because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;biases (unconscious or not) would still be at work, even if the editors are senior enough to not worry about making enemies;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;being an area chair or an action editor does go on the CV and is important for academic careers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But both of these problems can be avoided if we simply embrace the openReview model:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the papers are made available for all to see as anonymous preprints;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the anonymous reviews and decisions are also available for all to see;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there are open comments from the public (and the reviewers would be incentivized to write better reviews if they could not see the open comments until they submitted their opinions);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the papers would already start collecting citations;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the system could be set up to provide some kind of receipts for those who need proof of authorship for job applications;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;having a public record of community engaging with papers would be helpful for early career researchers, especially when non-experts evaluate their grant proposals and tenure cases. For that same reason, the system should provide an option to hide non-constructive comments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, generally this could be a chance to develop a healthier relationship with preprints in the community: ideally we‚Äôd want to look at new work because we want to see the latest results in the area we care about - not because it is something publicized by someone influential. Imagine an openReview-like system equipped with a daily feed of preprints in each subfield. Further imagine that, unlike arXiv, it comes with a dedicated chat/forum, tied to each paper. The RocketChat experience in ACL 2020 made it painfully clear how useful that would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;arxiv feed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;‚Äúreview+accept‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; all papers will have to be discussed either anonymously or post-acceptance, and the rush to see new ideas should help to develop a culture for looking at the work itself. To make things even more interesting, we could disallow the reviewers to see the public discussions until they submitted their own reviews - which would further incentivize them to write better reviews. For the papers that generated good discussions, the authors might choose to keep such discussions public:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I‚Äôve made the case that stage 2 really has to be fully anonymous. But NLP is moving at breakneck speed, and the authors would shoot themselves in the foot to not ‚Äúpublish‚Äù their work as soon as it was reviewed. We could offer the option of anonymous preprints, but if it were optional, most people would not go for it because directly publicizing your work would generate much more attention. And then the acceptance decisions would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be made anonymously. And should the paper be rejected and opt to return to the reviewing pool, the second round of reviewing will be inherently compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and that‚Äôs something that the community would welcome very much. First, for better or worse, we have this huge class of NLP engineering papers where a big part of claim is the SOTA status of the system. Such papers literally cannot afford to not be accepted at once. It is an open question whether we we might want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@vered1986/a-potential-approach-to-address-the-explosion-of-nlp-paper-submissions-50afa04bcd4c&quot;&gt;consider them a separate paper type that should not compete with ‚Äúmore sciency‚Äù papers&lt;/a&gt;, but faster turnaround is crucial for other paper types too: longer waits means higher chances of getting scooped, and/or the necessity of update baseline experiments with whatever-became-SOTA-since-submission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even if ACL were to go down the road of lowering acceptance rates, I‚Äôd argue that the cons of fully anonymous peer review are logistic, and the pros are existential. That makes the game very well worth the candle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more plus of &lt;em&gt;‚Äúreview+accept‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; is that we have a better chance to establish the culture of discussing anonymous preprints. In both proposals, there will be a pool of papers under review which could be made open to comments from non-reviewers (as long as there‚Äôs no COI, and the reviewers do not see those comments until they finish their own). But in &lt;em&gt;‚Äúreview, then accept‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; there will be papers that were already deanonymized and then open for discussion: that again has potential for heated discussions around work by big names, which by itself would additionally bias the acceptance decisions. In a way, this is what we have already: it is already possible to post an anonymous preprint, but the chances for anonymous work to get any attention in the flood of preprints propelled by the authors are slim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my case for fully anonymous reviewing, and for peer review rather than PR review. Since we‚Äôre reforming the review system anyway, we have a chance to actually change things - and there is a way to do that which combines full anonymity with the benefits of faster turnaround and a culture of discussing anonymous work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not in any way involved in the decision-making, nor am I an authority on any of the above issues. However, the ACL review reform committee does solicit community feedback, and might reconsider the &lt;em&gt;review+accept&lt;/em&gt; option if there is enough community support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this post will generate further discussion; to that end, I‚Äôll update the post with a link to a Twitter discussion thread, and I would appreciate any pointers to conversations emerging elsewhere. My goal is to listen, learn, and update this write-up with any necessary clarifications, nuances, further suggestions and counter-counter arguments. Then it‚Äôd be great to run some polls to see what the community would prefer. And then ACL will have a clearer case to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is based on many conversations with much wiser people, including (alphabetically) Isabelle Augenstein, Emily M. Bender, Jason Eisner, Matt Gardner, Yoav Goldberb, Jacob Anna Korhonen, Graham Neubig, Amanda Stent, and many others. Any misinterpretation is my own. Separate thanks to Emily M. Bender and Matt Gardner for their comments on this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[UPDATE 07.2020]&lt;/em&gt; The post generated &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/annargrs/status/1283758686515732480?s=20&quot;&gt;some discussion&lt;/a&gt;, people submitted feedback to the ACL reform committee using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=9028kaqAQ0OMdrEjlJf7WQiNRJRoOx9OlzQS6C5hck5URVc2MDZPRFBVNDRRRjBaMjBQVk41RVpMOC4u&quot;&gt;official feedback form&lt;/a&gt;. No response from the committee so far. Fingers crossed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Update 12.2020]&lt;/em&gt; While we‚Äôre waiting - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejlt.org/&quot;&gt;NEJLT&lt;/a&gt; is a new journal for computational linguistics research that implements a fully anonymous review process, all the way up to the editors. Check it out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dangerous-preconceptions-about-resource-papers&quot;&gt;Dangerous preconceptions about resource papers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most success stories in NLP are about supervised or semi-supervised learning. Fundamentally, that means that our parsers, sentiment classifiers, QA systems and everything else are only as good as the training data, and that fact makes data and model engineering equally important for further progress. This is why top-tier conferences of Association for Computational Linguistics usually have a dedicated ‚ÄúResources and evaluation‚Äù track, and awards for best resource papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, creating models and resources are tasks that require different skill sets, traditionally come from different fields, and are often performed by people who have different expectations of what a paper should look like. That turns reviewer assignment into a minefield: an apple looks wrong if you expect an orange. With the best intentions on all sides, a paper may be rejected not for any actual flaws, but for its fundamental methodology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post grew out of online and offline discussions with many frustrated authors. One thing is clear: a submission is a waste of both the authors‚Äô and the reviewers‚Äô time, if they fundamentally disagree about what a paper should even look like. 
 I hope it would help the people who &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; data to better understand the people who &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; data, and to provide better reviews for their papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us start by dispelling some myths about resource papers. Unfortunately, all the quotes below come from real *ACL reviews!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;myth-1-resource-papers-are-not-science&quot;&gt;Myth 1: Resource papers are not science&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the clearest example of this view is &lt;a href=&quot;https://rbawden.wordpress.com/2019/07/19/one-paper-nine-reviews/&quot;&gt;cited&lt;/a&gt; by Rachel Bawden. An ACL 2019 reviewer gave the following opinion of her MT-mediated bilingual dialogue resource &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#bawden2019diabla&quot;&gt;(Bawden, Rosset, Lavergne, &amp;amp; Bilinski, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The paper is mostly a description of the corpus and its collection and contains little scientific contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- Here is a fresh report from ACL 2020:

&gt; We got three positive reviews (4-4-3.5) for our recent #acl2020nlp short paper submission, but the meta-reviewer rejected it with this concluding statement: &quot;Given the limited novelty of the idea and the fact that no new method is proposed, this is basically a 'resource paper'.&quot; --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that ACL 2019 had a dedicated ‚ÄúResource and evaluation‚Äù area, it seems impossible that this kind of argument should even be made, much less considered acceptable in a review! To be clear, construction of resources does add knowledge in at least 3 ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;they are prerequisite to any knowledge obtainable from modeling;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in addition to the resource, there may be annotation guidelines or new data collection methodology;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iterative guidelines development based on annotation increases the knowledge of long-tail phenomena.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;myth-2-resource-papers-are-more-appropriate-for-lrec-or-workshops&quot;&gt;Myth 2: Resource papers are more appropriate for LREC or workshops&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most *ACL conferences offer a dedicated ‚ÄúResource and evaluation‚Äù track, yet the authors of resource papers are often advised to take their work to LREC or some thematic workshop instead. Again, let us borrow a quote from &lt;a href=&quot;https://rbawden.wordpress.com/2019/07/19/one-paper-nine-reviews/&quot;&gt;Rachel Bawden‚Äôs ACL 2019 review&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This paper is not suitable for ACL in my opinion..  It is very suitable for LREC and for MT specific conferences and workshops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This view is perhaps related to the widespread perception that NLP system engineering work is somehow more prestigious than work on resources. Since *ACL conferences are top-tier, resource papers should almost by definition go to workshops and the lower-ranking LREC conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This view is both unfair and counter-productive. First, the authors of NLP engineering papers typically get several chances to submit to main conferences during a year. LREC is the only conference specializing in resources, and it‚Äôs bi-annual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the progress in NLP depends on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ehudreiter.com/2020/03/02/why-use-18-year-old-bleu/&quot;&gt;co-evolution of systems and benchmarks&lt;/a&gt;. NLP benchmarks are not perfect, and when we get stuck on any of them for too long we are likely to start optimizing for the wrong thing, publishing a lot of SOTA-claiming papers, but making no real progress. Therefore, development of more challenging benchmarks is as important as modeling work, and publications at top-tier conferences is the least we could do to incentivize it. Also, putting data and models in different conferences is unlikely to improve the flow of ideas between the two communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;myth-3-a-new-resource-must-be-bigger-than-competition&quot;&gt;Myth 3: A new resource must be bigger than competition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have received a version of this myself at ACL 2020:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the new corpus presented in this work is not larger than the existing corpora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This argument is the resource paper version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackingsemantics.xyz/2020/reviewing-models/&quot;&gt;reject-if-not-SOTA approach in reviewing NLP system papers&lt;/a&gt;. Test performance offers an easy heuristics to judge the potential impact of a new model, and dataset size becomes a proxy for its utility. In both cases, work from industry and well-funded labs gets an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since large volume tends to be inversely proportional to data quality, this attitude implicitly encourages crowdsourcing and discourages expert annotation. The above ACL 2020 submission contributed a resource with expert linguistic annotation, for which there existed larger-but-noisier crowdsourced alternatives. The paper specifically discussed why directly comparing these resources by size makes little sense. Still, one of the reviewers argued that the new corpus is smaller than the crowdsourced one, and that apparently made it less valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;myth-4-a-resource-has-to-be-either-english-or-very-cross-lingual&quot;&gt;Myth 4: A resource has to be either English or very cross-lingual&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of languages seems to perform roughly the same function as the size of the dataset: a heuristic for judging its potential impact. Here is a quote provided by Robert Munro from another ACL review:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúOverall, there is no good indication that the good results obtained ‚Ä¶ would be obtainable for other pairs of languages‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an absolutely valid criticism that applies‚Ä¶ to the majority of all NLP papers, which only focus on English, but talk about modeling ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù (#BenderRule). Therefore, if this argument is allowed, every single paper must be demanded to be cross-lingual. But instead it tends to be brought up by reviewers of non-English resource papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is that such work is being marginalized and discouraged. I had a chance to visit Riga for &lt;a href=&quot;https://esslli2019.folli.info/welcome-to-esslli-2019/&quot;&gt;ESSLLI 2019&lt;/a&gt; and mingle with some amazing Latvian researchers who work on NLP systems for their language. They told me that they gave up on the main *ACL conferences, as their work is deemed too narrow and of no interest to the majority. This is a loss for everyone: it is far from easy to transfer ideas that worked for English to other languages, and the tricks that these Latvian researchers come up with could be of much use across the globe. Moreover, if our goal in the NLP community is to model ‚Äúhuman language‚Äù, we are unlikely to succeed by only looking at one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflating the number of languages with potential impact of the paper leads to an interesting consequence to cross-lingual studies: the more languages they have, the better they are in the eyes of the reviewers. However, if any meaningful analysis in all these languages is performed, the number of languages typically grows as a function of the author list length: the Universal Dependencies paper has 85 authors &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#NivreAgicEtAl_2015_Universal_Dependencies_12&quot;&gt;(Nivre et al., 2015)&lt;/a&gt;. An average machine learning lab has no means to do anything like that, so to please the reviewers they have an incentive to resort to machine translation, even for making typological claims &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#SinghMcCannEtAl_2019_BERT_is_Not_Interlingua_and_Bias_of_Tokenization&quot;&gt;(Singh, McCann, Socher, &amp;amp; Xiong, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;. In that case, the number of languages is unlikely to be a good proxy for the overall quality of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;myth-5-too-many-datasets-already&quot;&gt;Myth 5: Too many datasets already&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of this argument from an EMNLP 2019 review:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This paper presents yet another question answering test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, this particular reviewer went on to say that a new benchmark could have a place under the sun if it contributed some drastically new methodology. Still, the implicit assumption is that there should be a cap on resource papers, that it is somehow counter-productive to have a lot of question answering data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An argument could be made that having a lot of benchmarks dilutes the community effort. However, that only holds if there is one benchmark that is inherently better than all others. If that is not the case, focusing on just one dataset is more likely to be counter-productive. With a multitude of datasets we can at least conduct better generalization studies. For instance, consider the findings that models trained on SQuAD, CoQA and QuAC do not transfer to each other, even though all three datasets are based on Wikipedia &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Yatskar_2019_Qualitative_Comparison_of_CoQA_SQuAD_20_and_QuAC&quot;&gt;(Yatskar, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the same argument can be made about systems papers: should there be a cap on how many incremental modifications of BERT &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#RogersKovalevaEtAl_2020_Primer_in_BERTology_What_we_know_about_how_BERT_works&quot;&gt;(Rogers, Kovaleva, &amp;amp; Rumshisky, 2020)&lt;/a&gt; the community should produce before the next breakthrough?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;myth-6-every-acl-resource-paper-has-to-come-with-dl-experiments&quot;&gt;Myth 6: Every *ACL resource paper has to come with DL experiments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the above myths are straightforward to rebuff, because they reflect logical fallacies and predispositions to dislike research that does not resemble a mainstream NLP system paper. But there is one that seems to correspond to a genuine rift in the community:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Going on with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/NLProc?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#NLProc&lt;/a&gt; peer review debate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most thorny issue so far: should *ACL should require resource papers to have some proof-of-concept application?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* FOR: no ML experiments =&amp;gt; go to LREC&lt;br /&gt;* AGAINST: super-new methodology/ high-impact data could suffice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your take?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Anna Rogers (@annargrs) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/annargrs/status/1247593874794713089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dozens of comments later, it became clear that people simply think of different things when they hear ‚Äúresource paper‚Äù. Whether DL experiments are required or even appropriate depends on the type of contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;NLP tasks/benchmarks&lt;/em&gt;: the main argument is typically that the new benchmark is more challenging than previous ones. That claim obviously must be supported by experimental results.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Computational linguistic resources&lt;/em&gt; (lexicons, dictionaries, grammars): the value is in offering a detailed description of language from some point of view, as complete as possible. Something like VerbNet is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; created for any particular DL application, and should not be required to include any such experiments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In between these two extremes are the kinds of resources that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be easily framed as DL tasks/benchmarks, but it is not clear whether that &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be required, or even is the best thing to do. Specifically, this concerns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Non-public data releases&lt;/em&gt;: the resources of data that was non publicly available before, such as anonymized medical data or data from private companies. The author contribution is the legal/administrative work that made the release possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resources with linguistic annotation&lt;/em&gt; (treebanks, coreference, anaphora, temporal relations, etc.): the quality of these resources is traditionally measured by inter-annotator agreement. The author contribution is the annotation effort and/or annotation methodology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both of these cases, the data may be used in many different ways. It could be possible to just offer standard train/test splits and present the resource as a new task or benchmark, making life easier for practitioners who are simply looking for a new task to set their favorite algorithm on. But this may be not the only, or even the best way to think of the new data. At this point, the discussion turns into an unscientific tug-of-war along the following lines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engineer:&lt;/em&gt; Is this data for me? Then I want to see experiments showing that it‚Äôs learnable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Linguist:&lt;/em&gt; This is actually about language, not deep learning. But you‚Äôre welcome to use this data if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this gray area, I would make &lt;strong&gt;a plea for the area chairs to decide what they expect, and to make it clear to both the authors and the reviewers&lt;/strong&gt;. Otherwise we get a review minefield situation: the baseline experiments are perceived as a hard requirement by some reviewers, but the authors did not anticipate it. Their submissions become a waste of time for the authors, the tired reviewers and the ACs. This waste could be easily prevented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I would argue against the hard requirement of baseline experiments, for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;NLP is an interdisciplinary venture, and we need all the help we can get. Requiring that every submission comes wrapped in machine learning methodology would discourage the flow of data and ideas from people with different skill sets, not only in linguistics, but also fields like sociology and psychology.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Including such experiments would likely not make either side happy. The linguists will be left with questions that could have been answered if the authors didn‚Äôt have to include baselines. The engineers would only look at the baseline section and find it unimpressive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give a concrete example, one of my papers contributed a new sentiment annotation scheme, a new dataset, and also showed some baseline experiments &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#RogersRomanovEtAl_2018_RuSentiment_Enriched_Sentiment_Analysis_Dataset_for_Social_Media_in_Russian&quot;&gt;(Rogers et al., 2018)&lt;/a&gt;. One of the weaknesses pointed out by the reviewers was this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The results obtained using in-domain word embeddings are not surprising. It is a well-known fact that in-domain word embeddings are more informative with respect to the generic ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our comment about in-domain embeddings simply described the table of results and was not meant to come as a revelation. The contribution was in the resource and methodology. But the very presence of these experiments apparently set off the wrong kind of expectations. Our paper was accepted, but many others probably fell in this trap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-write-a-good-review&quot;&gt;How to write a good review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;am-i-the-right-reviewer-for-this-paper&quot;&gt;Am I the right reviewer for this paper?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apples are apples, oranges are oranges, and both are good in their own way. It is pointless to reject a resource paper for not being a systems paper. To write a constructive review, first of all you need to see its contribution from the same methodological perspective as the authors. If there is a mismatch, if you‚Äôve been assigned a paper with a type of contribution that is not in your research sphere, it is better to &lt;strong&gt;ask the AC to reassign it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the major types of resource papers, and the expertise needed to write a high-quality review:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Crowdsourced NLP training or testing datasets: knowledge of basic crowdsourcing methodology, awareness of potential problems such as artifacts &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#GururanganSwayamdiptaEtAl_2018_Annotation_Artifacts_in_Natural_Language_Inference_Data&quot;&gt;(Gururangan et al., 2018)&lt;/a&gt; and annotator bias &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#GevaGoldbergEtAl_2019_Are_We_Modeling_Task_or_Annotator_Investigation_of_Annotator_Bias_in_Natural_Language_Understanding_Datasets&quot;&gt;(Geva, Goldberg, &amp;amp; Berant, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;, as well as other available datasets for this task. &lt;em&gt;Ideally, you‚Äôve built at least one resource of this type yourself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Corpora with linguistic annotation (syntax, anaphora, coreference, temporal relations): knowledge of the relevant linguistic theory and annotation experience, annotation reliability estimation, and existing resources in this particular subfield. &lt;em&gt;Ideally, you‚Äôve built at least one resource of this type yourself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Linguistic knowledge resources (grammars, dictionaries, lexical databases): knowledge of the rest of linguistic theory and all the other relevant resources. &lt;em&gt;Ideally, you‚Äôve built at least one resource of this type yourself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about non-English resources? We can‚Äôt expect to always have the pool of reviewers who are experts in the right areas and also speak a given rare language, so the answer is probably ‚Äúdivision of labor‚Äù. When we register for conferences as reviewers, we could all specify which languages we speak, in addition to our areas of expertise. If a resource (or systems) paper is not on English, the ACs would ideally try to find at least one reviewer who does speak that language, in addition to two experts in the target area. People who don‚Äôt speak the language could still evaluate the parts of the contribution that you can judge (methodology, analysis, meaningful comparisons to other work). As long as we are clear in your review what parts of the paper were out of your scope, the AC will be able to make informed decisions and recruit extra reviewers if necessary. The authors should of course help their own case by including glosses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-makes-an-acl-worthy-resource-paper&quot;&gt;What makes an *ACL-worthy resource paper?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you made sure that you are looking at the paper from the same methodological perspective as the authors, you need to actually judge its contribution. Of course, not every resource paper deserves to be published at a top NLP conference! The acceptance criteria are really not that different for systems and resources. Most conferences are interested in how novel is the approach, how substantial the contribution, how big the potential impact. The authors of an *ACL-worthy paper, of any type, do need to make a strong case on &lt;strong&gt;at least one&lt;/strong&gt; of these counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of the types of resource papers that would (and wouldn‚Äôt) fit these criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High novelty&lt;/strong&gt;: significant conceptual innovation &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Examples&lt;/em&gt;: new task, new annotation methodology; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Counter-examples&lt;/em&gt;: using an existing framework to collect more data or update an existing resource, or simply translating an existing resource to another language.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High impact&lt;/strong&gt;: addressing a widespread problem, presenting new methodology with high generalizability (across languages or tasks).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Examples&lt;/em&gt;: discovering biases that affect multiple datasets, releasing time-sensitive data (e.g. the recent dataset of research papers on coronavirus); &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Counter-examples&lt;/em&gt;: mitigating a specific bias induced by annotator guidelines in one specific dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High quality, richness, or size&lt;/strong&gt;: significant public data releases that offer clear advantages in the depth of linguistic description, data quality, or volume of the resource.&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;em&gt;Examples&lt;/em&gt;: linguistic databases like VerbNet, corpora with linguistic annotation, data collected organically in specific contexts (such as anonymized medical data);&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Counter-examples&lt;/em&gt;: noisy data without clear advantages over alternatives, non-openly-available data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reiterate: a paper could be publication-worthy by meeting only &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; of these criteria. A narrow problem can be solved in a highly novel way. A noisy dataset can have high impact if it‚Äôs all there is. A resource simply recast to another language might make big waves if it shows that the techniques developed for the English version completely fail to generalize. But the authors do need to show that at least one criterion applies strongly, and convince the reviewers that there are no serious flaws (e.g. if the inter-annotator agreement was inflated by discarding large portions of data).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;everything-wrong-with-reject-if-not-sota&quot;&gt;Everything wrong with reject-if-not-SOTA&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After each reviewing round for a major conference, #NLProc Twitter erupts with bitter reports of methods rejected for failing to achieve the state-of-the-art status (SOTA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Another @emnlp2019 reviewer&amp;#39;s 3-line review concludes: &amp;quot;The main weakness of the paper is the results do not beat the state of the art models.&amp;quot; This is a tired take and a lazy, backwards way to think about research.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Jesse Thomason (@_jessethomason_) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_jessethomason_/status/1147587570634645504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 6, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of attitude gives the impression of a completely broken peer-review system, discouraging new minds from even trying to enter the field. Only last month I gave an invited talk for an advanced NLP class in UMass Lowell, telling the students of &lt;a href=&quot;https://text-machine-lab.github.io/blog/2020/quail/&quot;&gt;a new QA benchmark&lt;/a&gt; that they could try. After the class a few students came up to me and said they were interested, but they were concerned that it would be a priori futile: whatever they did, they probably would not be able to beat the huge models released monthly by the top industry labs. Note that this was a class in a major US university, so the students in less favorable environments probably feel even more discouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the coveted SOTA &lt;a href=&quot;https://lukeoakdenrayner.wordpress.com/2019/09/19/ai-competitions-dont-produce-useful-models/&quot;&gt;does not even necessarily advance the field&lt;/a&gt;. Looking at a popular leaderboard like &lt;a href=&quot;https://gluebenchmark.com/&quot;&gt;GLUE&lt;/a&gt;, can we really conclude that the top system has the best &lt;em&gt;architecture&lt;/em&gt;? When the test score differences are marginal, any of the following could be in play:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;variation induced by extraneous factors, from linear algebra library version to random initializations &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Crane_2018_Questionable_Answers_in_Question_Answering_Research_Reproducibility_and_Variability_of_Published_Results&quot;&gt;(Crane, 2018; Dodge et al., 2020)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how well the model is tuned, which depends on how much computation budget the authors had &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#DodgeGururanganEtAl_2019_Show_Your_Work_Improved_Reporting_of_Experimental_Results&quot;&gt;(Dodge, Gururangan, Card, Schwartz, &amp;amp; Smith, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;. If even BERT &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#DevlinChangEtAl_2019_BERT_Pre-training_of_Deep_Bidirectional_Transformers_for_Language_Understanding&quot;&gt;(Devlin, Chang, Lee, &amp;amp; Toutanova, 2019)&lt;/a&gt; was ‚Äúsignificantly undertrained‚Äù &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#LiuOttEtAl_2019_RoBERTa_Robustly_Optimized_BERT_Pretraining_Approach&quot;&gt;(Liu et al., 2019)&lt;/a&gt;, what about work from smaller labs?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;differences in model size, amount of pre-training data, and pre-training time: increasing any of them could be expected to yield improvements, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackingsemantics.xyz/2019/leaderboards/&quot;&gt;that is not research news&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the benchmarks we have are not perfect &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#McCoyPavlickEtAl_2019_Right_for_Wrong_Reasons_Diagnosing_Syntactic_Heuristics_in_Natural_Language_Inference&quot;&gt;(McCoy, Pavlick, &amp;amp; Linzen, 2019; Sugawara, Stenetorp, Inui, &amp;amp; Aizawa, 2020; Jia &amp;amp; Liang, 2017)&lt;/a&gt;, and 1% improvement in the range past human performance may indicate the system is actually worse, i.e. it overfits to the dataset at the cost of generalizability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to all the above issues, the leaderboards put us in a hamster wheel. They are updated so quickly that SOTA claims should really be taken as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tallinzen/status/1193904779191365632?s=20&quot;&gt;‚ÄúSOTA at the time of submitting this paper‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;. If the paper is accepted, it will likely lose the SOTA status even before publication. If it is rejected, the authors &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nlpmattg/status/1220089814717886464?s=20&quot;&gt;have to try their luck at the next conference &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; being able to claim SOTA anymore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SOTA chase takes an absurd twist when a tired reviewer glances at the leaderboard and dislikes the paper for not including the very latest models. For instance, at least two EMNLP 2019 reviewers requested a comparison with XLNet &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#YangDaiEtAl_2019_XLNet_Generalized_Autoregressive_Pretraining_for_Language_Understanding&quot;&gt;(Yang et al., 2019)&lt;/a&gt;, which topped the leaderboards &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the EMNLP submission deadline:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;re &amp;quot;Why not consider other models? such as XLNet&amp;quot;: I agree with the reviewer on the importance of time travel research, but it&amp;#39;s slightly out of the scope of this paper.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Kyunghyun Cho (@kchonyc) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kchonyc/status/1149826779999363072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 12, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-did-we-get-here&quot;&gt;How did we get here?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the above makes so much sense that one has to wonder how we even got to reject-if-not-SOTA. Surely, the people who get asked to review for top NLP conferences know all this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would conjecture that two factors are in play:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The fact that we are &lt;em&gt;drowning&lt;/em&gt; in papers, and need heuristics to decide what to read/tweet/publish. SOTA is just one such heuristic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Glorification of benchmarks, coupled with the initial trajectory of deep learning community within NLP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first factor deserves its own post. The lack of time, the low prestige and lack of career or monetary compensation for reviewing means that people are strongly incentivized to rely on heuristics, of which SOTA is just one example. To combat that, we need deep, systemic changes, which will take a long time to implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second factor is specific to the reject-if-not-SOTA. Ehud Reiter makes a useful &lt;a href=&quot;https://ehudreiter.com/2020/03/02/why-use-18-year-old-bleu/&quot;&gt;distinction&lt;/a&gt; between ‚Äúevaluation metrics‚Äù vs ‚Äúscoring functions‚Äù. Language is complex, and our benchmarks far from perfect, so ideally we would have (1) the introduction of a benchmark, (2) a wave of system papers that hopefully reaches human performance, and then (3) a massive switch to an improved benchmark. Instead, we get stuck in step 2, and the benchmark becomes a scoring function that simply enables the community to publish tons of SOTA-claiming papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we now have &lt;a href=&quot;https://super.gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard&quot;&gt;SuperGLUE&lt;/a&gt; and over 80 QA datasets, but new system papers will still mostly evaluate on &lt;a href=&quot;https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/&quot;&gt;SQuAD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard&quot;&gt;GLUE&lt;/a&gt;, because these are the names that the reviewers most likely know and expect. Since both SQuAD and GLUE are solved well past human baselines, the result is likely an exercise in overfitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, while the benchmark problem is nothing new, the current SOTA chase might have had an extra push from the fact that there was a massive wave of papers with the common trajectory: taking some task/dataset and showing that a neural method could handle it better than was possible before. Many of these papers were written by new authors, and they might still expect the same kind of contributions. But that expectation is outdated. &lt;a href=&quot;#everything-wrong-with-reject-if-not-sota&quot;&gt;As discussed above,&lt;/a&gt; the current leaderboards do not necessarily indicate superiority of the &lt;em&gt;architecture&lt;/em&gt;, and the very possibility of using neural nets for different NLP tasks is now taken for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Common misunderstanding about research: a set of routines *that constitute research* at time A may no longer at time B &amp;gt; A.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;solution-guidelines-on-what-constitutes-an-acceptable-contribution&quot;&gt;Solution: guidelines on what constitutes an acceptable contribution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, SOTA is just one of the heuristics that the tired and underpaid reviewers are resorting to to cope with the deluge of papers, and in the long run we need to implement systemic changes to the review system. But there is something we could do right now to mitigate this particular heuristic: we could &lt;em&gt;expand&lt;/em&gt; it. Performance is just one of many factors that could make a system interesting. What is we had guidelines for authors, reviewers and ACs, which would contain a list of publication-worthy contributions ‚Äì of which SOTA would be just one? The authors would then have a fighting chance against the SOTA heuristic in the rebuttals, and the reviewers would hopefully be discouraged from using it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, compiling such guidelines is admittedly not easy: no paper is perfect. The best reviewers are weighing the strengths and the weaknesses of papers on case-by-case basis, necessarily comparing apples to oranges with some degree of subjectivity. Still, for starters, here is a list compiled from many Twitter discussions &lt;a href=&quot;#share--cite--discuss-this-post&quot;&gt;(suggestions welcome)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A new system may make be publication-worthy if it has a strong edge over the competition in one or more of the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;better performance (significantly and consistently higher than the competition, and surpassing variability due to random initializations);&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;more computation-efficient (less resources to train and/or deploy);&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;more data-efficient (requires less data to train, or less high-quality data);&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;more stable over possible hyperparameters and/or random initializations, easier to tune;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;better generalizability (less biased, able to avoid learning from data artifacts, better generalizing across datasets and domains, more adversarially robust);&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;having different properties (e.g. different output type, making different kinds of predictions and errors);&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;more interpretable (humans can engage with the output better, easier to understand where it goes wrong and how to fix it);&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;conceptually simpler (this would likely overlap with computation efficiency and stability);&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;more cognitively plausible (more consistent with what is known about human language processing);&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;making unexpected connections between subfields, bringing some technique in a completely new context;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that for any of these criteria &lt;strong&gt;the study should clearly state its hypothesis (doing X as opposed to Y is expected to have the effect Z), and prove/disprove it for the reviewers with appropriate experiments&lt;/strong&gt;. If the proposal is only a minor incremental modification of an existing model, and its only hope of publication was beating SOTA, then the authors would be unlikely to be able to claim any of the other factors retroactively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above list aims to give a fighting chance to systems that perform well &lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt; offering some other kind of advantage, such as generalizability/efficiency etc. But given the history of deep learning, it should not be impossible to publish a valuable idea, even if for some reason it could not be made to perform well yet. However, the idea should be actually novel, rather than ‚Äújust make it bigger‚Äù. A rule-of-thumb criterion for a paper with an interesting idea (attributed to Serge Abiteboul) is that you‚Äôd feel tempted to have your students read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reject-if-not-sota-and-non-modeling-papers&quot;&gt;Reject-if-not-SOTA and non-modeling papers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would seem that NLP system papers are the ones the most affected by the reject-if-not-SOTA heuristic, but they are actually the priviledged class because at least they &lt;em&gt;contain&lt;/em&gt; the kind of experiments that the reject-if-not-SOTA reviewers expect. All other kinds of papers are just unacceptable by definition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;systematic parameter and tuning studies;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;model analysis, representation probing papers, ablation studies;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;resource papers;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;surveys;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;work on ethical considerations in NLP;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;opinion pieces, especially retrospectives (bridging DL and prior methods), cross-disciplinary contributions, papers connecting subfields that work on the similar phenomenon under different names;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviewing all these different kinds of papers properly deserve separate posts, but they are all a legitimate part of *ACL conferences. For resources in particular, consider again that ideally the field should cycle through (1) the introduction of a benchmark, (2) a wave of system papers that hopefully reaches human performance, and then (3) a massive switch to an improved benchmark. If the difficult interdisciplinary work on improving benchmarks is not rewarded on par with system engineering work, who would bother?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rachel Bawden &lt;a href=&quot;https://rbawden.wordpress.com/2019/07/19/one-paper-nine-reviews/&quot;&gt;cites&lt;/a&gt; an ACL 2019 reviewer who gave the following account of her MT-mediated bilingual dialogue resource:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The paper is mostly a description of the corpus and its collection and contains little scientific contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviewers with CS backgrounds who are not interested in methodology, theoretical, linguistic, or psychological work should not simply reject these kinds of contributions, recommending that the authors try LREC or workshops. They should &lt;strong&gt;decline the assignment and ask the ACs to find a better match&lt;/strong&gt;. NLP is an interdisciplinary field, human language is incredibly complex, and we need all the help we can get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update (09.05.2020): Here is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackingsemantics.xyz/2020/reviewing-data/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; specifically on dos and don‚Äôts in reviewing resource papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOTA is just one of many other heuristics used by reviewers and everybody else to decide what is worth paying attention to. Heuristics stem from the paper deluge and the difficulties navigating an interdisciplinary field with just one degree. The field is in dire need of systemic changes to make reviewing visible, compensated, and high-prestige work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one thing we could realistically do about the SOTA heuristic right now is to at least have clear guidelines for both the authors and reviewers of NLP system papers. These guidelines should emphasize that there are many possible publication-worthy types of contributions: we need breakthroughs in models that are energy- and data-efficient, transparent, cognitively plausible, generalizable etc. Welcoming them would stimulate intellectual diversity of approaches, greener solutions, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and participation by less well-funded labs from all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2020-events-for-your-sota-free-paper&quot;&gt;2020 events for your SOTA-free paper&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre concerned about the above issues, here are some events and workshops this year that work towards mitigating it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Efficient NLP systems: &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/sustainlp2019&quot;&gt;SustaiNLP&lt;/a&gt; workshop at EMNLP 2020&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insights-workshop.github.io/&quot;&gt;Workshop on Insights from Negative Results&lt;/a&gt; invites short papers describing failures that we should learn from, rather than ignore;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nlpevaluation2020.github.io/&quot;&gt;Evaluation and Comparison of NLP Systems&lt;/a&gt; at EMNLP 2020: designing evaluation metrics, reporting trustworthy results and creating adequate and correct evaluation data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note also that &lt;a href=&quot;https://2020.emnlp.org/call-for-papers&quot;&gt;EMNLP 2020&lt;/a&gt; implements a reproducibility checklist based on work by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ReproducibilityChecklist.pdf&quot;&gt;Joel Pinneau&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#DodgeGururanganEtAl_2019_Show_Your_Work_Improved_Reporting_of_Experimental_Results&quot;&gt;(Dodge, Gururangan, Card, Schwartz, &amp;amp; Smith, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;, which includes the number of hyperparameter search trials and some measure of performance ‚Äúmean and variance as a function of the number of hyperparameter trials‚Äù. Hopefully that by itself should draw some of the reviewers‚Äô attention towards model efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

It‚Äôs not clear whether NLP models should be biologically plausible or explicitly encode any linguistic structures ‚Äì but we do know that language is a very complex thing, and no discipline has been able to solve all the problems on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt take just my word for it. Here‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://allenai.org/ai2-israel/&quot;&gt;Yoav Goldberg‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; slide from his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e12danHhlic&quot;&gt;SpacyIRL 2019 talk&lt;/a&gt;: the future NLP will require both linguistic and machine learning expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/goldberg-spacyirl.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider also the raising investment in cross-disciplinary programs in all kinds of data science, aimed to train the new ‚Äúbilingual‚Äù task force. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/StateofAIReport/state-of-ai-report-2019-151804430&quot;&gt;State of AI 2019&lt;/a&gt; reports the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/state-of-ai-report-2019-48-1024.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we need to train this new taskforce. Great idea, right? Let‚Äôs just do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-cross-disciplinary-programs-are-hard&quot;&gt;Why cross-disciplinary programs are hard.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is, of course, that true interdisciplinarity requires working knowledge of more than one field. This comes at the time when both arXiv and conferences are exploding, and we can barely keep up with the literature even within one narrow sub-field of NLP. Now, imagine that NLP is your second field, and in addition to the arXiv insanity, you also need to keep track of all the latest research on linguistic typology or whatever your original field is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it‚Äôs not just about reading more literature. It‚Äôs also learning a different mindset, a different way to set and solve problems. In case of NLP for linguistics, it takes time to start seeing everything as ‚Äútasks‚Äù, and to formulate research hypotheses in a such a way that they could be proved or falsified by ML experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case of NLP for linguistics, it also involves acquiring a whole lot of technical knowledge that should have come from a large series of undergraduate courses ‚Äì all in your spare time. Somebody willing to do this must have not only above-average dedication and amount of spare time, but also unusual willingness to look beyond the basic tenets of one‚Äôs original discipline. This is objectively hard, and not for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;case-study-introductory-nlp-at-esslli-2019&quot;&gt;Case study: Introductory NLP at ESSLLI 2019&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backgound: I‚Äôve taught in both CS and linguistics university programs before, and I‚Äôm told I‚Äôm a pretty good lecturer. I have some experience developing curricula, and, most importantly, I‚Äôm someone who made the transition from cognitive semantics to a machine learning lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of that, I came to &lt;a href=&quot;https://esslli2019.folli.info/welcome-to-esslli-2019/&quot;&gt;ESSLLI&lt;/a&gt; to teach a 2-week introductory NLP course for theoretical linguists, confident I knew how to do this right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-original-plan&quot;&gt;The original plan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In week 1 my goal was to provide the minimal skill set for getting, processing, and experimenting with textual data with Python, as well as fundamentals of machine learning. In week 2 I aimed to cover the basic neural architectures and the latest issues in evaluation and creation of datasets. I assumed that the students would have only the basic Python skills from an online course (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edx.org/course/6-00-1x-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python-3&quot;&gt;this excellent edX course&lt;/a&gt; that I started from myself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds doable, right? I had very positive feedback for my proposal and, as an ex-linguist, I thought I knew what I was getting into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the Murphy law did not fail to apply. Here are some things I learned the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problem-1-the-pool-of-students-is-incredibly-diverse&quot;&gt;Problem 1: the pool of students is incredibly diverse.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ESSLLI is a very unique environment where you can meet literally anybody. I was preparing with the linguists in mind, but I found that my class had also physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers (at least 2 of each). Some of the linguists also had much more coding experience than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this is not only a problem for ESSLLI, and would probably would apply to any elective NLP or data science course. For example, I have just taught a UMass introductory Data Science course aimed at business majors, and I had everybody from chemists to political science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means two things for the lecturer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;at any point you can safely assume that a part of the audience is either bored or confused.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;at any point you can get any kind of question, from something very basic to something you can‚Äôt even answer on the spot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To balance out boredom and confusion, and also to acknowledge the impossibility of humans attending to any one thing for 90 minutes straight, my strategy was to split the class into a short lecture (~30-40 min out of 90) and a hands-on tutorial in Jupyter. I prepared the lectures with the confused part of the audience in mind, and I assumed that the bored part will just dive into Jupyter and keep themselves occupied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I was definitely not prepared for everything:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 3em auto !important;&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Teaching an intro PyTorch tutorial at ESSLLI. Audience is 80% linguists, and I start very confident I know how to talk to former colleagues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A question halfway into the tutorial:&lt;br /&gt;- Sorry, what is &amp;quot;GPU&amp;quot;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Sound of my brain overclocking to reassess the rest of the material)&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Anna Rogers (@annargrs) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/annargrs/status/1161237977638625281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 13, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problem-2-basic-python-is-not-enough&quot;&gt;Problem 2: basic Python is not enough&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assumed that the students would have taken an online Python course, which in my mind implied familiarity with functions and classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I should have realized is that object-oriented programming is not something that a beginner is going to be able to actually use after just a set of exercises. I know many non-CS researchers who rely on Python heavily for daily experimentation - and manage to do most of it procedurally, in Jupyter notebooks. They might write a few functions to load/save their data that they copy-paste routinely, but they‚Äôre not going anywhere near classes. They really don‚Äôt need it for what they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means for an NLP course is that if your deep learning framework relies on relatively complex programming constructs like classes, your students will be stuck with programming before they can even start to get stuck with partial derivatives. I chose vanilla PyTorch, with the goal of showing the students all the building blocks of a simple feed-forward network. My code was heavily commented, and they were able to run it, but I honestly have no idea how much of it could possibly sink in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm still debating with myself whether I should have just gone with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fast.ai/&quot;&gt;fast.ai&lt;/a&gt;. If the goal is to just give people tools to run pre-packaged models, then it would definitely be achieved much more efficiently than what I did. But if the goal is, eventually, research, then awareness of all the individual components is certainly to be encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problem-3-emerging-curricula-mess&quot;&gt;Problem 3: emerging-curricula mess&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time that I got my ESSLLI proposal accepted, I did one thing very wrong: I did not try to check what other courses there were, and whether there was potential overlap. The result was that in both weeks of ESSLLI there were two courses with partly overlapping material, that the majority of students taking my classes also attended, and I had to frantically reorganize and add material. In my case, I ended up relying on other people for the overview of fancy neural nets, and using the time for more datasets and methodology discussion, which nobody else was doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, this is to be expected from a summer school which is a unique, throw-everyone-together event - but I would strongly suspect that an emerging data science program would also have some mess in curricula, because‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ this is all emerging disciplines, and NLP in particular changes so fast that if I were to come to ESSLLI again next year I‚Äôd have to replace at least 20% of the material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The takeaway here is that interdisciplinary programs require also above-average attention to the overall curriculum structure, seeing how your piece fits with everything else that your target students are taking, and NLP in particular requires above-average monitoring of the recent developments. Say, if tomorrow graph neural networks top all leaderboards, we‚Äôll have to somehow teach them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PyTorch actually helped me to make this point. The students installed version 1.1 in week 1, and by the time we got to week 2 the version 1.2 was already out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problem-4-introduction-to-nlp-is-actually-at-least-3-courses&quot;&gt;Problem 4: ‚ÄúIntroduction to NLP‚Äù is actually at least 3 courses.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a big misconception on my part. I really needed to teach 3 different things, all in the space of a single course:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) The data part: formats, pre-processing, pipeline components, available resources, potential effects, biases and artifacts. By now, this should clearly be a course in itself, and the one where the linguists can immediately make the most difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) The machine learning part: the fundamentals of machine learning experiments, variance/bias, linear and logistic regression, basic neural nets, rnns, attention‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) The actual NLP, which comes at the intersection of (1) and (2). Discussing the latest cool stuff such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://thegradient.pub/nlps-clever-hans-moment-has-arrived/&quot;&gt;the BERT meltdown&lt;/a&gt; is really not feasible without both of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If possible, I would perhaps sub-split distributional meaning representations as a course separate from (3), with a gentle primer on linear algebra. That one has to be really gentle, and not longer than 30 minutes at a time. I did make a desperate attempt to run through matrix factorization in half a lecture, as I believe it‚Äôs important to think of word2vec&amp;amp;co in context of count-based baselines. I really appreciate the bravery of my students who still showed up on the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, in the course of 10 90-minute lectures and tutorials, I was able to fit maybe 15-30% of each of these courses. If I were to develop a curriculum for the next year‚Äôs ESSLLI, I‚Äôd try to make sure that there would be a course for (1) and (2) independently, in week 1, so that in week 2 someone would proceed with the actual NLP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;to-conclude&quot;&gt;To conclude&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is what I learned the hard way, and I hope might be helpful for other people working on cross-disciplinary courses. My materials are available on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/esslli2019-nlp/home&quot;&gt;course website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd like to thank ESSLLI organizers, the great city of Riga (with its fantastic food), and, of course, all of my very brave students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/esslli2019.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm particularly grateful to the students who came up later and shared their stories. A few of them were in strong computational programs, but many were theoretical linguists, language teachers, translators, students of literature, in departments without a single computational linguist, with no one to ask for advice. These are the people who keep struggling with online coding courses in their spare time, and nobody‚Äôs there to tell them that it‚Äôs totally normal to spend 5 hours hunting for a silly bug. At least 50% of the class were women, which means 2x impostor syndrome. Rather than getting recognized for their attempt to go across the fence, they feel like they‚Äôre wasting time on something they will never be able to do well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this, because that‚Äôs exactly how I felt for a really long time, too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Anna Rogers</name></author><category term="squib" /><category term="academia" /><category term="teaching" /><summary type="html">What I learned from organizing an introductory course on NLP for linguists at ESSLLI 2019.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Talking to people outside your echo chamber: SocNLP challenges</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/conversation/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Talking to people outside your echo chamber: SocNLP challenges" /><published>2019-07-21T11:00:47-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-21T11:00:47-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/conversation</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/conversation/">&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This blog is NOT political, even though the story below will show some of my political views. I‚Äôm sharing it because it highlights a burning issue in computational social science that is getting nowhere near enough attention. Reader beware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;academics-and-populism&quot;&gt;Academics and Populism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most researchers I know, I‚Äôve been politically apathetic until a few years ago. Politicians were doing their stuff, I was doing mine, all according to the basic principles of representative democracy and everybody being professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there came the populist wave, and more and more academics started wearing activist hats. If the elected politicians seem to have no idea what they are doing, the professional in us demands trying to do something about it. Isn‚Äôt it obvious that the world is complex and big decisions should be made by experts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, no. It‚Äôs obvious to you, the reader of my academic blog who probably has a PhD or two. Most of the world doesn‚Äôt have a PhD or two. These other people are angry about the world changing under their feet, frustrated with its complexity, scared. And all around they only see people like themselves. You, dear reader, are not represented there, for you have been living in your own bubble, and you have so far been completely irrelevant to their concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then in comes the populist. He does one thing right: he addresses all the pent-up anger, frustration, fear of change. He promises a solution - an appealingly simple one. This solution runs against every bit of evidence that the experts have, but from the point of view of the people without PhDs that‚Äôs actually ok because (a) the experts get things wrong too, and (b) the experts are obviously not interested in addressing the above concerns of people without PhDs. If anything, it‚Äôs the expert‚Äôs work that‚Äôs making the world less and less comprehensible. And now there‚Äôs finally a guy who is actually talking to these people, for a change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‚Äúsolution‚Äù the people are offered will actually make their lives worse, not better - but they never took a statistics class. And so the populist is riding the anger wave to victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brexit movie provides a helpful demonstration of what happens when we‚Äôre trying to fact-check the populist‚Äôs arguments. All we need to do is to prove the populist wrong, to get the facts straight, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YpP6ZdsBgmE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;padding-top:1em; padding-bottom:1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Fact-checking won‚Äôt help because the populst is talking to the emotions of these people. &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/838321/nonviolent-communication-the-scientifically-proven-step-by-step-guide-to-having-a-breakthrough-conversation-across-party-lines/&quot;&gt;Until the emotions are addressed, no facts will get through&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;case-study-an-evangelical-trump-supporter&quot;&gt;Case study: an evangelical Trump supporter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs an Uber ride I will never forget. I was in a new area (Buffalo, NY), I wanted to learn more about it, and the driver (let‚Äôs call him Dave) was very talkative. According to Dave, the place was very vibrant, with all kinds of jobs, opportunities, fun, and strong economy (it didn‚Äôt actually look like any of that to me, and Dave‚Äôs own car was quite beat-up). It was also full of good God-loving people who supported Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the theses that came my way in a steady stream, with almost no prompting, were the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Democrats are trying to impeach Trump because he is not allowing them to take the Word of God from schools and courts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trump is mentioned in Bible. He‚Äôs obviously the trumpet before the Judgement Day. There‚Äôs a prophecy of him ruling for 8 years.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trump is fundamentally a good Christian who never did any of the bad stuff that the media are lying about.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All technology is evil (including Dave‚Äôs own car and his phone, except when he uses the phone for reading Bible). But Trump, thankfully, is taking the country back to 1800s when it was the richest country and everything was good and people worried about God and not stars in the sky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear reader of my academic blog with a PhD degree: I know what you‚Äôre thinking. But let‚Äôs try to resist the urge to dismiss Dave as a certifiable lunatic who shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to admit I am a terrible actress. I was unable to maintain a straight face, and was only saved by my hat and the fact that Dave was driving and watching the road rather than me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I‚Äôm proud to say that I was able to not laugh, to not ridicule any of the above theses, to not sound as a militant atheist. To not come off as an elitist intellectual jerk with zero points of intersection with Dave‚Äôs version of reality. I did get out of his car with his saying it was nice talking to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did I bother? Why should we all try harder for such an outcome? Simply because there are many more people like Dave than like you and me. And we all live in democracies, a.k.a. the worst form of government except all others. Unless our minority manages to share our knowledge in a way that would actually address the concerns and improve the lives of the frustrated majority, the populism is going to march on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs also worth pondering over the fact that we have more knowledge than Dave largely because we were luckier with where we were born. Many of his views are ridiculous, but he as a human being is not. I sincerely hope I don‚Äôt sound condescending or patronising in writing this, for that‚Äôs neither my intention nor sentiment. I think that we fundamentally share a desire for a better world and each other‚Äôs well-being, and we both believe we know how to help with that. We just dramatically disagree on the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I took a deep breath and decided to try to get us to agree about something. I cautiously led the conversation to the evils of technology that is destroying the environment, and got him to say that Jesus would probably not want that. Then I threw in Trump‚Äôs pulling out of the Paris agreement. Dave wasn‚Äôt aware of either its existence or the fact of Trump‚Äôs pulling out. He said there must have been a good reason. I brought up the oil lobbying. Then his mind somehow jumped to oil in Iran and Israel (???), and I couldn‚Äôt bring him back before the car stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear reader, these conversations are much, much harder than talking even to your most bitter academic opponents. I am spoiled with people staying on track of the discussion, and even helpfully making conclusions from what has been agreed on. Neither was the case with Dave, and I did not know how to handle that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave exists, and there are millions like him who will easily outvote the handful of us smarty pants. In doing so, they will be badly deceived, and the result will be bad for both them and us. And it will be partly the fault of us smarty pants who are not communicating at the right level and with the right kind of empathy. Needless to say, this goes far beyond Trump and US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conversation with Dave, I only get the points for being able to sustain a civil conversation, and maybe for getting one new fact across. But here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd do differently next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;Start from establishing empathy&lt;/strong&gt;. That‚Äôs actually fairly easy, because life is hard for all of us, only in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;Avoid non-starters&lt;/strong&gt;. I did ask how come Christians vote for Trump with his self-admitted grabbing women. Dave was unwilling to believe anything coming from the press, and I probably sounded confrontational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;3) &lt;strong&gt;Mention being a researcher&lt;/strong&gt;. Even if you fail to convey any information, hopefully there would be a memory of researchers being real and nice people, and not completely out of touch with the reality of Dave‚Äôs life. Most likely, he has no face for the broad category of ‚Äúexperts‚Äù, like I didn‚Äôt have a face for ‚Äúevangelical Trump supporters‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;4) &lt;strong&gt;Practice the poker face&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People inherently prefer simplicity and coherence. We all build our own biased model of the world as we go, and we will try to just ignore/discard any facts not fitting in. Sawing doubt is only possible by presenting conflicting evidence on something that a mind is not yet cemented against. In this case, it turns out that Dave does NOT actually follow news obsessively, and facts that come from a friendly-looking concrete person rather than the abstract enemy-of-the-people-press might get in - given that the empathy has been established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I did do right was &lt;strong&gt;reframing&lt;/strong&gt;. Dave and I both care about environmental issues, but taking his perspective (religious) made it easier to bring in new facts. Here‚Äôa &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/robb_willer_how_to_have_better_political_conversations&quot;&gt;a great TEDx talk on the technique, with a conservative/liberal case study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implications-for-computational-social-science&quot;&gt;Implications for computational social science&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we‚Äôve known about the echo chamber effects &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Pariser_2011_Beware_online_filter_bubbles&quot;&gt;(Pariser, 2011; Pariser, 2011)&lt;/a&gt; for a while. Still, nothing much seems to be happening. In fact, even when the users are shown just how coccooned they are, the diversity of their connections does not increase &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#GillaniYuanEtAl_2018_Me_My_Echo_Chamber_and_I_Introspection_on_Social_Media_Polarization&quot;&gt;(Gillani, Yuan, Saveski, Vosoughi, &amp;amp; Roy, 2018)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several successful projects for starting conversations across political spectrum, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hifromtheotherside.com/&quot;&gt;Hi From The Other Side&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fiskkit.com/&quot;&gt;Fiskitt&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kialo.com/&quot;&gt;Kialo&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent debate tool. There are also a few tools for visualizing the bubbles, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed/&quot;&gt;Blue Feed, Red Feed by Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;www.readacrosstheaisle.com&quot;&gt;Read Across the Aisle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.allsides.com/unbiased-balanced-news&quot;&gt;All sides&lt;/a&gt;. Multiple organizations are now engaged in fact-checking and flagging clickbait and fake news stories, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.factcheck.org/fake-news/&quot;&gt;FactCheck.org&lt;/a&gt;. Still, all these efforts only target the people who actively self-select and already assume the other side is worth talking to. Dave would probably not be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the trouble starts on social media, and most people don‚Äôt go anywhere else, this is where the changes need to happen. That depends on the goodwill of companies whose business fundamentally depends on echo chambers. But let‚Äôs say they do want to change &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Greene_2019_How_Twitter_shapes_global_public_conversation_Jack_Dorsey_speaks_at_TED2019&quot;&gt;(Greene, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;. How is it even possible, after everybody got so used to the mental comfort of their echo chambers? How can we reach out beyond the slim margin of people who are already open-minded enough to sign up for ‚ÄúHi from the other side‚Äù?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt have the answers, but here are some ideas of how NLP could help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Matching people from opposing communities who have better chances of finding a common ground, to facilitate cross-bubble conversation. For instance, it is more difficult for me to find a common ground with Dave than for someone who is progressive, but also religious.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tracking the sources of funding for polytical ads, and displaying those alongside with the ad, prominently: the organization, what it lobbies for, known polytical connections.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We know very little about the actual effectiveness of targeted advertising. Each campaign is unique and impossible to repeat, and it‚Äôs equally impossible to tell precisely how effective its tactics were. For instance, there is an opinion that Cambridge Analytica problem was overblown because the effectiveness of targeting based on personality traits is unclear &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Chen_2018_Cambridge_Analyticas_Facebook_data_abuse_shouldnt_get_credit_for_Trump&quot;&gt;(Chen, 2018)&lt;/a&gt;. To me, it looks like a rashed conclusion, since the election results were very close, and the process can never be reproduced.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of time and money is invested into factchecking, but it‚Äôs not effectiveness is unclear &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#DeCarbonnel_2019_Exclusive_Echo_chambers_-_Fake_news_fact-checks_hobbled_by_low&quot;&gt;(De Carbonnel, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;. We need more research on how that could be enhanced. See above: the conversation has to start with empathy, simply correcting the facts probably will not work at all.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cesar Hidalgo (MIT) suggests a ‚Äúflip feed‚Äù button that would show you stories from the other side &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Adee_2016_How_can_Facebook_and_its_users_burst_filter_bubble&quot;&gt;(Adee, 2016)&lt;/a&gt;. Clearly, if you‚Äôre in a bubble, there‚Äôs already an algorithm that knows what your bubble is. I‚Äôd argue that it could be more productive to not completely flip the feed, but to gradually widen it with bridge stories.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need more research into not just detection of hate speech and abuse, but in ways to promote constructive conversations. Non-experts could probably use more tools for visualizing and connecting the evidence that‚Äôs coming in. Experts definitely need some kind of reminders to humanize and empathize, rather than only drown the non-experts in facts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last point, let‚Äôs all start offline. When we are lucky to meet a Dave, let‚Äôs just try to do a better job of reaching out. We‚Äôve only got this one planet. We need his help, and he needs ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In real world, fake news spread faster than facts. People‚Äôs attention is caught by sensational, exaggerated, clickbait-y messages like ‚Äú5.23 million more immigrants are moving to the UK‚Äù. Any subsequent fact-checking messages look less sensational and they will not reach as many people. Once the damage is done, it‚Äôs done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank God this never happens in academia. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts are as susceptible as the rest of the populace - see for example Daniel Kahneman‚Äôs account of an author of a statistics textbook who readily went with stereotype rather than provided base rate information &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Kahneman_2013_Thinking_fast_and_slow&quot;&gt;(Kahneman, 2013)&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe we - researchers - have it even worse, because we also have to publish-or-perish. The publication treadmill demands eye-catching, breakthrough results that can‚Äôt possibly be produced at the required speed. We rarely have the problem of people deliberately faking results, but‚Ä¶ how shall I put it‚Ä¶ there isn‚Äôt exactly an incentive to triple-check things before they land on Arxiv. If you happen to be right, you get to be the first to publish that, and if you‚Äôre wrong - no shame in it, you can always revise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The readers are not necessarily triple-checking either. For an academic publication it would require much more than a google search, so we rarely bother unless we‚Äôre reviewing or replicating. The worst case scenario is when the shiny but hasty result also conforms to your own intuitions about how things should work - i.e. when you‚Äôre told something you want to believe anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is what happened to word analogies &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#MikolovChenEtAl_2013_Efficient_estimation_of_word_representations_in_vector_space&quot;&gt;(Mikolov, Chen, Corrado, &amp;amp; Dean, 2013)&lt;/a&gt;. Its &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;amp;user=oBu8kMMAAAAJ&quot;&gt;over 11K citations&lt;/a&gt; are mostly due to the hugely popular word2vec architecture, but the idea of word analogies rode the same wave. A separate paper on ‚Äúlinguistic regularities‚Äù &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#MikolovYihEtAl_2013_Linguistic_Regularities_in_Continuous_Space_Word_Representations&quot;&gt;(Mikolov, Yih, &amp;amp; Zweig, 2013)&lt;/a&gt; currently has extra 2K citations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These citations are not just something from 2013 either. Because it‚Äôs so tempting to believe that language really works this way, the word analogies are still everywhere. Only in June 2019, I heard them mentioned in the first 10 minutes of a NAACL invited talk, in a word embeddings lecture in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ciss.deephack.me/&quot;&gt;CISS dialogue summer school&lt;/a&gt;, and all over Twitter. It just soo makes sense that language relations are all neat and regular like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/analogy-mikolov.png&quot; class=&quot;width70&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;!--figcaption&gt;some figure&lt;/figcaption--&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that may be too good to be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;all-things-wrong-with-word-analogies&quot;&gt;All things wrong with word analogies.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the best of my knowledge, the first suspicions about vector offset arose when it didn‚Äôt work for lexicographic relations &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#KoperScheibleEtAl_2015_Multilingual_reliability_and_semantic_structure_of_continuous_word_spaces&quot;&gt;(K√∂per, Scheible, &amp;amp; im Walde, 2015)&lt;/a&gt; - a pattern later confirmed by &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#KarpinskaLiEtAl_2018_Subcharacter_Information_in_Japanese_Embeddings_When_Is_It_Worth_It&quot;&gt;(Karpinska, Li, Rogers, &amp;amp; Drozd, 2018)&lt;/a&gt;. Then the BATS dataset &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#GladkovaDrozdEtAl_2016_Analogybased_detection_of_morphological_and_semantic_relations_with_word_embeddings_what_works_and_what_doesnt&quot;&gt;(Gladkova, Drozd, &amp;amp; Matsuoka, 2016)&lt;/a&gt; offered a larger balanced sample of 40 relations, among which the vector offset worked well only on those that happened to be included in the original Google dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/analogy-bats2.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;When does the vector offset work? 40 relations from the BATS dataset&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why doesn‚Äôt it generalize, if language relations are so neat and regular? Well, it turns out that it wouldn‚Äôt have worked in the first place if the 3 source words were not excluded from the set of possible answers. In the original formulation, the solution to &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;king-man+woman&lt;/script&gt; should be &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;queen&lt;/script&gt;, given that the vectors &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;king&lt;/script&gt;, &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;man&lt;/script&gt; and &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;woman&lt;/script&gt; are excluded from the set of possible answers. Tal Linzen showed that for some relations you get considerable accuracy by simply getting the nearest neighbor of &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;woman&lt;/script&gt; word, or the one most similar to both &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;woman&lt;/script&gt; and &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;king&lt;/script&gt; (without &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;man&lt;/script&gt;) &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Linzen_2016_Issues_in_evaluating_semantic_spaces_using_word_analogies&quot;&gt;(Linzen, 2016)&lt;/a&gt;. And here‚Äôs what happens if you don‚Äôt exclude any of them &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#RogersDrozdEtAl_2017_Too_Many_Problems_of_Analogical_Reasoning_with_Word_Vectors&quot;&gt;(Rogers, Drozd, &amp;amp; Li, 2017)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/analogy-honest.png&quot; class=&quot;width60&quot; /&gt; 
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Share of BATS analogy questions in which the vector the closest to the predicted vector is one of the source vectors (a,a', b), the target vector b', or some other vector. In most cases the result is simply the vector b (&quot;woman&quot;).
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If in most cases the predicted vector is the closest to the source &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;woman&lt;/script&gt; vector, it means that the vector offset is simply too small to induce a meaning shift on its own. And that means that adding it will not get you somewhere significantly different. Which means you‚Äôre staying in the neighborhood of the original vectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some more experiments showing that if the source vectors &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;a&lt;/script&gt; (‚Äúman‚Äù), &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;a'&lt;/script&gt; (king), and &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;b&lt;/script&gt; (‚Äúwoman‚Äù) are excluded, your likelihood to succeed depends on how close the correct answer is to the source words &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#RogersDrozdEtAl_2017_Too_Many_Problems_of_Analogical_Reasoning_with_Word_Vectors&quot;&gt;(Rogers, Drozd, &amp;amp; Li, 2017)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/analogy-sim-bias.png&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;The share of BATS analogy questions predicted successfully vs similarity of the target vector to the source vectors&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could object that this is due to bad word embeddings, and ideal embeddings would have every possible relation encoded so that it would be recoverable from vector offset. That remains to be shown empirically, but from theoretical perspective it is not likely to happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Semantically, the idea of manipulating vector differences is reminiscent of componential analysis of the 1950s, and there are good reasons why that is no longer actively developed. For example, does ‚Äúman‚Äù + ‚Äúunmarried‚Äù as definition of ‚Äúbachelor‚Äù apply to Pope?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Distributionally, even seemingly perfect analogy between &lt;em&gt;cat:cats&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;table:tables&lt;/em&gt; are never perfect. For example, &lt;em&gt;turn the tables&lt;/em&gt; is not the same as &lt;em&gt;turn the table&lt;/em&gt;, they will appear in different contexts - but that difference does not apply to &lt;em&gt;cat:cats&lt;/em&gt;. Given hundreds of such differences, why would we expect the aggregate representations to always perfectly line up? And if they did, would that even be a good representation of language semantics? If we are to ever have good language generation, we need to be able to take into account such nuances, not to discard them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up: several research papers brought up good reasons to doubt the efficacy of vector offset. If the formulation of vector offset excludes the source vectors, it will appear to work for the small original dataset, where much of its success can be attributed to basic cosine similarity. But it will fail to generalize to a larger set of linguistic relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lack-of-impact-on-further-research&quot;&gt;(Lack of) impact on further research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus of this post is not just the above negative evidence about vector offset, but the fact that these multiple reports of negative results never reached the same audience of thousands of researchers who were impressed by the original Mikolov‚Äôs paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I‚Äôm impartial here because some of this work is mine, but isn‚Äôt it just counter-productive for the field in general? If there are serious updates to a widely cited but too-good-to-be-true paper, it is in everybody‚Äôs interest for those updates to travel fast. They could save people the effort of either doing the same work again, or the wasted effort of building on the original untested assumption. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the problem with publishing negative results is well-known, and perhaps it‚Äôs not coincidental that only one of the above papers even made it to one of the main conferences. However, there are now two ACL, one COLING, and one best-paper-mention ICML paper that provide mathematical proofs for why the vector offset &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; work &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#GittensAchlioptasEtAl_2017_SkipGram_Zipf_Uniform_Vector_Additivity&quot;&gt;(Gittens, Achlioptas, &amp;amp; Mahoney, 2017; Hakami, Hayashi, &amp;amp; Bollegala, 2018; Ethayarajh, Duvenaud, &amp;amp; Hirst, 2019; Allen &amp;amp; Hospedales, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;. Go figure. Only one paper also took a mathematical perspective, but bravely arrived at the opposite conclusion &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Schluter_2018_Word_Analogy_Testing_Caveat&quot;&gt;(Schluter, 2018)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, these positions need to be reconciled in the future. I am fully open to the possibility that the vector offset does indeed work, and the above negative evidence is somehow wrong. That would actually be great for everybody, as it would mean that we already have an intuitive, cheap, and reliable way to perform analogical reasoning. But that still needs to be shown, and so far the papers providing proofs for vector offset did not address the available negative evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider that if the negative evidence is correct, this has serious implications for the field. It would mean that we are pursuing a simplistic model of linguistic relations that is not representative of most of language. For instance, the vector offset attracted the attention of researchers on fairness/bias, and many practitioners actually use it in earnest. Here‚Äôs a NIPS paper that started from accepting that the underlying vector offset mechanism works: &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#BolukbasiChangEtAl_2016_Man_is_to_Computer_Programmer_As_Woman_is_to_Homemaker_Debiasing_Word_Embeddings&quot;&gt;(Bolukbasi, Chang, Zou, Saligrama, &amp;amp; Kalai, 2016)&lt;/a&gt;. But this one didn‚Äôt: &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#NissimvanNoordEtAl_2019_Fair_is_Better_than_SensationalMan_is_to_Doctor_as_Woman_is_to_Doctor&quot;&gt;(Nissim, van Noord, &amp;amp; van der Goot, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;. Let me quote the authors on what it would mean to make social conclusions on the basis of unreliable metrics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/analogy-nissim.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude: analogical reasoning is an incredibly important aspect of human reasoning, and we &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to get it right if we‚Äôre ever to arrive at general AI. So far, from what I‚Äôve seen, linear vector offsets in word embeddings are not the right way to think of it. But there are plenty of other directions, including better methods for analogical reasoning &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#DrozdGladkovaEtAl_2016_Word_embeddings_analogies_and_machine_learning_beyond_king_man_woman_queen&quot;&gt;(Drozd, Gladkova, &amp;amp; Matsuoka, 2016; Vine, Geva, &amp;amp; Bruza, 2018; Bouraoui, Jameel, &amp;amp; Schockaert, 2018; Dufter &amp;amp; Sch√ºtze, 2019)&lt;/a&gt; and specialized representations for analogous pairs &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#WashioKato_2018_Neural_Latent_Relational_Analysis_to_Capture_Lexical_Semantic_Relations_in_a_Vector_Space&quot;&gt;(Washio &amp;amp; Kato, 2018; Joshi, Choi, Levy, Weld, &amp;amp; Zettlemoyer, 2018; Hakami &amp;amp; Bollegala, 2019; Camacho-Collados, Espinosa-Anke, &amp;amp; Schockaert, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;. If we‚Äôre not married to the ideal of natural language with impossibly regular relations, shouldn‚Äôt we try to maximize the research effort in more promising directions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-we-can-encourage-fact-checking-of-widespread-claims&quot;&gt;How we can encourage fact-checking of widespread claims&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with vector offset is not unique. Its components are (1) a shiny result that is intuitively appealing and becomes too-famous-to-be-questioned, (2) the low visibility of negative results, even when they are available. In NLP, the latter problem is aggravated by the insane Arxiv pace. When you work on ‚Äúa truth universally accepted‚Äù, and you can‚Äôt even keep up with the list of papers that you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to read, why would you bother searching for papers nobody cited?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is admittedly hard to make negative results sexy, but in high-profile cases I think it is doable. Why don‚Äôt we have an &lt;strong&gt;impactful-negative-result award category at ACL conferences&lt;/strong&gt;, to encourage fact-checking of at least the most widely-accepted assumptions? This would:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;increase the awareness of widespread problems, so that people do not build on shaky assumptions;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;identify high-profile research directions where more hands are needed next year, thus stimulating the overall progress in NLP;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;help with reproducibility crisis by encouraging replication studies and reporting of negative results.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in NAACL 2019 there were several interesting papers that could definitely be considered for such an award. A few personal favorites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;exposing the lack of transfer between QA datasets &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Yatskar_2019_Qualitative_Comparison_of_CoQA_SQuAD_20_and_QuAC&quot;&gt;(Yatskar, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;limitations of attention as ‚Äúexplaining‚Äù mechanism &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#JainWallace_2019_Attention_is_not_Explanation&quot;&gt;(Jain &amp;amp; Wallace, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;multimodal QA systems that work better by simply ignoring some of the input modalities &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#ThomasonGordonEtAl_2019_Shifting_Baseline_Single_Modality_Performance_on_Visual_Navigation_QA&quot;&gt;(Thomason, Gordon, &amp;amp; Bisk, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 out of 3 of these great papers were posters, and I can not imagine how many more did not even make it through review. I would argue that it sends a message to the people doing this important work, and it is the wrong message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, imagine that such an award existed, and was granted, say, to &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#Yatskar_2019_Qualitative_Comparison_of_CoQA_SQuAD_20_and_QuAC&quot;&gt;(Yatskar, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;. Then everybody in the final session got to hear about the lack of transfer between 3 popular QA datasets. QA is one of the most popular tasks, so wouldn‚Äôt it be good for the community to highlight the problem, so that next year more people focus on solving QA rather than particular datasets? Perhaps the impactful-negative-result paper could also be chosen so as to match next year‚Äôs theme.&lt;/p&gt;
