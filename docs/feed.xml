<p>When ACL Rolling Review was first launched, I wasn‚Äôt its biggest fan. The core motivation seemed to be that it would reduce the reviewer workload, and I am not convinced that that this goal is either achievable with ARR, or that it has in fact been achieved.</p>

<p>However, from bitter experience as a program chair of <a href="https://2023.aclweb.org/">ACL‚Äô23</a>, I am firmly convinced that we as a scientific community need a centralized and continually improving conference review system. If you have not been in that role, trust me: there are hundreds of things that you as a chair have to (a) know about, (b) remember about, (c) care enough about when it‚Äôs 2am, (d) know how to do well, (e) have support for in the system you‚Äôre using, (f) potentially argue with other chairs and the whole community about. This is why conference peer review is just way too complex to have a new set of chairs do it for the first time for every single conference - and too many people waste time and effort when anything goes wrong.</p>

<p>ARR is by no means perfect. I hope to help with fixing at least some of the issues while I‚Äôm there, but I know that even after I and everybody else do everything we can - it still won‚Äôt be perfect. Still, it‚Äôll be better, and we as a community will have an iteratively improving system that gradually accumulates documentation, software support, and people familiar with it. Just this, by itself, is a huge step in the right direction. The service time that people invest in this is a precious resource, and it should be reused and iterated on as much as possible.</p>

<p>Here are some of the things that I am hoping to help the team to get done:</p>

<ul>
  <li>updating the <a href="https://aclrollingreview.org/responsibleNLPresearch/">Responsible NLP checklist</a> (some questions are up for rethinking), and the way it is used</li>
  <li>updating the <a href="https://aclrollingreview.org/reviewertutorial">ARR reviewer guidelines</a>, in particular with respect to generative AI (in consultation with the new ACL committee on publication ethics)</li>
  <li>implementing the structured author complaints to chairs, which were very well-received at ACL‚Äô23, and which would allow the authors to flag reviews for specific types of issues (see sec.5.3 of <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.911/">ACL‚Äô23 report</a>)</li>
  <li>figuring out ways to support the chairs in implementing <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php/ACL_Anonymity_Policy">the new ACL anonymity policy</a> (according to which borderline anonymized papers have an advantage over preprinted papers)</li>
  <li>analyzing the effects of the change in anonymity policy</li>

<p>What comes below is an attempt to bring together some discussions on the state of NLP research post-chatGPT.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> We are NLP researchers, and at the absolute minimum our job is to preserve the fundamentals of scientific methodology. This post is primarily addressed to junior NLP researchers, but is also relevant for other members of the community who are wondering how the existence of such models should change their next paper. We make the case that as far as research and scientific publications are concerned, the ‚Äúclosed‚Äù models (as defined below) cannot be meaningfully studied, and they should not become a ‚Äúuniversal baseline‚Äù, the way BERT was for some time widely considered to be. The TLDR for this post is a simple proposed rule for reviewers and chairs (akin to the <a href="https://thegradient.pub/the-benderrule-on-naming-the-languages-we-study-and-why-it-matters/">Bender rule</a> that requires naming the studied languages):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>That which is not open and reasonably reproducible cannot be considered a requisite baseline.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>By ‚Äúopen‚Äù we mean here that the model is available for download, can be run offline (even if it takes non-trivial compute resources), and can be shared with other users even if the original provider no longer offers the model for download. ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù models support versioning, and document for each model version what training data they used. A model is ‚Äúclosed‚Äù if it is not open.</em></p>

<p><em>By ‚Äúreasonably reproducible‚Äù we mean that the creators released enough information publicly such that the model can be reproduced with the provided code, data, and specified compute resources, with some variation reasonably expected due to hardware/software variance, data attrition factors and non-determinism in neural networks. For instance, reproducing <a href="https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom">BLOOM</a> would require a super-computer - but at least theoretically it is possible, given the measures to open-source the code, collect and document the data. So it is ‚Äúreasonably reproducible‚Äù by our definition, even though not everybody could do it.</em></p>

<h2 id="relevance--popularity">Relevance != popularity</h2>

<p>Here‚Äôs a question many graduate students in NLP have been asking themselves recently:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">üßµWhat can graduate student researchers in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NLProc?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NLProc</a> do to stay relevant in a competitive research environment with disruptive technologies happening in the industry? A thread. 1/N</p>&mdash; William Wang (@WilliamWangNLP) <a href="https://twitter.com/WilliamWangNLP/status/1638328550247002113?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 21, 2023</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>This anxiety seems to be due partly to the fact that in our field, <strong>‚Äúrelevance‚Äù has been extremely popularity-driven</strong>. For the last decade, there has always been a Thing-Everybody-Is-Talking-About: a model or approach that would become a yardstick, a baseline that everybody would be wise to have in their papers to show that what they‚Äôve done is a meaningful improvement. This can be understood, since one of the driving <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3531146.3533083">values</a> of the ML community is improving upon past work ‚Äì otherwise, how would we know we are making progress, right? Post-2013 we had word2vec/GloVe, then there was a similar craze about BERT. Then GPT-3. And now ‚Äì ChatGPT and GPT-4.</p>

<p>Why does this happen? There are two lines of reasoning behind this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The-Thing-Everybody-Is-Talking-About is either likely to be truly state-of-the-art for whatever I‚Äôm doing, or a reasonable baseline, so I better have it in my paper and beat it with my model.</li>
  <li>As an author, my chances of publication depend in part on the reviewers liking my work, and hence the safest bet for me is to talk about something that most people are likely to be interested in - a.k.a The-Thing-Everybody-Is-Talking-About.</li>
</ol>

<p>(b) is actually a self-fulfilling prophecy: the more authors think this way, the more papers they write using The-Thing-Everybody-Is-Talking-About, which in turn reinforces the reviewers in the belief that that thing is really prerequisite. We see this cycle manifested as a mismatch between the beliefs of individual community members and their perception of others‚Äô views on what research directions should be prioritized (e.g. focus on benchmarks or scale), as documented in the <a href="https://nlpsurvey.net/">NLP Community Metasurvey</a>. Though it takes effort, members of the research community can push back against that kind of cycle (and we will discuss specific <a href="#we-do-have-options">strategies</a> for that below).  As for (a) - it made sense while The-Thing-Everybody-Is-Talking-About was actually something that one could meaningfully compare to.</p>

<p>The main point we would like to make is that this kind of reasoning simply no longer applies to closed models that do not disclose enough information about their architecture, training setup, data, and operations happening at inference time. It just doesn‚Äôt matter how many people say that they work well. Even without going into the dubious ethics of commercial LLMs, with copyright infringement lawsuits over <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-is-being-sued-over-github-copilot-piracy">code</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/artists-file-class-action-lawsuit-against-ai-image-generator-companies/">art</a> already underway, and <a href="https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/">unethically sourced labeled data</a> ‚Äì the basic research methodology demands it. Many, many people are bringing up the fact that as researchers, we are now in an impossible position:</p>

<h2 id="why-closed-models-as-requisite-baselines-would-break-nlp-research-narratives">Why closed models as requisite baselines would break NLP research narratives</h2>

<p>To make things more concrete, let us consider a few frequent ‚Äúresearch narratives‚Äù in NLP papers, and how they would be affected by using such ‚Äúclosed‚Äù models as baselines. We will use GPT-4 as a running example of a ‚Äúclosed‚Äù model that was released with <a href="https://virtualizationreview.com/articles/2023/03/15/gpt-4-details.aspx">almost no technical details</a>, despite being the subject of a 100-page report singing its praises, but the same points apply to other such models.</p>

<h3 id="we-propose-a-machine-learning-model-that-improves-on-the-state-of-the-art">‚ÄúWe propose a machine learning model that improves on the state-of-the-art‚Äù:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>To make the claim that our algorithm improves over whatever it is that a commercial model is doing, we need to at least know that we are doing something qualitatively different. If we are proposing some modification of a currently-popular approach (e.g., Transformers), without documentation, we simply cannot exclude that the ‚Äúclosed‚Äù model might be doing something similar.</li>
  <li>Even if we believe that we are doing something qualitatively different, we still need to be able to claim that any improvements are due to our proposed modification and not model size, the type and amount of data, important hyperparameters, ‚Äúlucky‚Äù random seed, etc. Since we don‚Äôt have any of this information for the closed ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù, we cannot meaningfully compare our model to it.</li>
  <li>And even if we ignore all the above factors ‚Äì to make a fair comparison with these models on some performance metric, we have to at least know that neither of our models has observed the test data. Which, for the ‚Äúclosed‚Äù model, we also don‚Äôt know. Even OpenAI itself was initially concerned about <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/1457c0d6bfcb4967418bfb8ac142f64a-Abstract.html">test data contamination with GPT-3</a>, which could not possibly have improved - especially after the whole world has obligingly tested chatGPT for months. And it <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-decontaminated-evaluation-of-gpt-4-38a27fc45c30">hasn‚Äôt improved</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The only thing that we as model developers can learn from the existence of GPT-4, is that this is the kind of performance that can be obtained with some unspecified combination of current methods and data. An upper bound or existence proof, which seems higher than existing alternatives. <strong>Upper bounds are important, and could serve as a source of motivation for our work, but they cannot be used as a point of comparison.</strong></p>

<h3 id="we-propose-a-new-challenging-taskbenchmarkmetric">‚ÄúWe propose a new challenging task/benchmark/metric‚Äù:</h3>

<p>Constructing good evaluation data is very hard and expensive work, and it makes sense to invest in it when we believe that it can be used as a public benchmark to measure progress in NLP models, at least for a few months. Examples of such benchmarks that have driven NLP research in the past include <a href="https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD</a>, <a href="https://gluebenchmark.com/">GLUE</a> and <a href="https://github.com/google/BIG-bench">BigBench</a>. But public benchmarks can only work if the test data remains hidden (and even then <a href="https://laurenoakdenrayner.com/2019/09/19/ai-competitions-dont-produce-useful-models/">eventually people evaluate too many times</a> and start to implicitly overfit). This is obviously incompatible with the scenario where the developer of the popular ‚Äúclosed‚Äù models, only accessible via API, keeps our submitted data and may use it for training. And unless the models explicitly describe <em>and share</em> their training data, we have no way of auditing this.</p>

<p>This means that our efforts will be basically single-use as far as the models by that developer are concerned. The next iteration will likely ‚Äúace‚Äù it (but not for the right reasons).</p>

<p>Let us consider OpenAI policies in this respect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ChatGPT <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7039943-data-usage-for-consumer-services-faq">by default keeps your data and may use it for training</a>. It is said to provide an <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7039943-data-usage-for-consumer-services-faq">opt-out</a> of data collection.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies">OpenAI API policy</a> was updated on March 1 2023, and currently states that by default data is not retained and not used for training. Whatever was submitted before this date, can be used, so we can safely assume that much if not all of existing public benchmark data has been submitted to GPT-3 since 2020, including the labels or ‚Äúgold‚Äù answers - at least those that were used as few-shot prompts. Interestingly, OpenAI then uses the contamination as a reason to exclude some evaluations but not others: the GPT4 tech report says that they did not evaluate on BIG-bench because of data contamination (in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774v3">v.3</a> of the report it‚Äôs footnote 5 on p.6), although they do present their results for 100% contaminated GRE writing exams (Table 9).</li>
</ul>

<p>The overall problem is that opt-outs and even opt-ins are not sufficient in the case of something meant to be a public benchmark: as dataset creators, the future of our work might be affected not only by our own use of our data - but also by anybody else using it! It takes just one other researcher who wasn‚Äôt careful to opt-out, or wasn‚Äôt able to ‚Äì and our data is ‚Äúpoisoned‚Äù with respect to future models by that developer. Even if only some few-shot examples are submitted, they might be used to somehow auto-augment similar user prompts. Last but not least, if we make our data public, the model developers themselves could also proactively add it to the training data, looking to improve their model. If the labels or the ‚Äúgold‚Äù answers are not public for an important benchmark, it would be worthwhile for them to create some similar data.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs unclear yet how to solve this problem. Perhaps there will soon appear some special version of robots.txt that both prohibits use for AI training, <em>and</em> requires that any resharing of this data keeps the same flag. And, hopefully, the large companies will eventually be required to comply, and be subject to audits. <strong>In the short-term, it seems like the only option is to simply not trust or produce benchmark results for models where test-train overlap analysis cannot be performed.</strong></p>

<h3 id="we-show-that-model-x-doesdoesnt-do-y-model-analysis-and-interpretability">‚ÄúWe show that model X does/doesn‚Äôt do Y: (model analysis and interpretability)</h3>

<p>Since we only have access to GPT-4 via the API, we can only probe model outputs. If the plan is to use existing probing datasets or construct new ones, we have the same resource problem described above (the previously used probing datasets might have been trained on, the previously used techniques could have been optimized for, the new work will be single-use, and still have the train-test overlap problem to an unknown extent).</p>

<p>Furthermore, at least some of these models seem to intentionally not produce identical outputs when queried with the same probe and settings (perhaps via random seeds or different versions of the model being used in parallel). In this case, whatever results we get may already be different for someone else, which puts our basic conclusions at risk. This could include, for instance, the reviewers of the paper, who will rightfully conclude that what our report may not be true. Moreover, if the developer keeps tweaking the model as we go, then by the time we finish writing the paper, the model could change (perhaps even based on our own data). Which would also make our work not only obsolete before it is even reviewed, but also incorrect.</p>

<p>This issue might be addressed by ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù given versions of the model and committing to keep them available to researchers, but there is hardly any incentive<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> for for-profit companies to do so. For instance, some popular models including Codex/code-davinci-002 have already been <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3">deprecated</a>. We also have no public information about what changes lead or do not lead to a new version number (and it is likely that at least the filters are updated continually, as users are trying to break the model).</p>

<p>Last but not least, consider the effect of showing that model X does/doesn‚Äôt do Y:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>‚ÄúModel does Y‚Äù</em>: without test-train overlap guarantees this is not necessarily a statement about the model. For example, chatGPT was reported to be able to play chess (<a href="https://medium.com/@ivanreznikov/how-good-is-chatgpt-at-playing-chess-spoiler-youll-be-impressed-35b2d3ac024a">badly</a>). That looks unexpected of something that you consider a language model, but if you knew that it has seen a lot of chess data - it is hardly newsworthy that a language model can predict a plausible-looking sequence of moves. Basically, instead of discovering properties of a language model (which could be a research finding), we‚Äôre discovering that the internet dump it was trained on contained some chess data.</li>
  <li>‚Äú<em>Model doesn‚Äôt do Y</em>‚Äù: by collecting cases where the model seems to fail, we implicitly help the commercial entity controlling that model to ‚Äúfix‚Äù those specific cases, and further blur the line between ‚Äúemergent‚Äù language model properties and test cases leaked in training. In fact, GPT-4 was already trained on user interactions gathered during the mass testing of ChatGPT, which provided Open AI with millions of free examples, including ‚Äúcorrected‚Äù responses to prompts submitted by users. In the long run, our work would make it harder for the next researcher to examine the next ‚Äúclosed‚Äù model. What‚Äôs even worse, it would decrease the number of easy-to-spot errors that might prevent ordinary users from falling for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect">Eliza effect</a>, hence increasing their trust in these systems (even though they are still fundamentally unreliable).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In summary, by showing that a closed model X does/doesn‚Äôt do Y we would likely not contribute to the general understanding of such models, and/or exacerbate the evaluation issues.</strong></p>

<h3 id="we-show-that-model-x-is-unfairbiased-etc-ai-ethics"><strong>‚ÄúWe show that model X is (un)fair/biased etc‚Äù:</strong> (AI ethics)</h3>

<p>Let us say that we somehow showed that the closed model yields some specific type of misinformation or misrepresents a given identity group (as it was done e.g. for <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3461702.3462624">anti-Muslim bias in GPT-3</a>). The most likely outcome for such work is that this specific kind of output will be quickly ‚Äúpatched‚Äù, perhaps before we even publish the paper. The result is that (a) our hard work is short-lived, which may matter for researcher careers, (b) we actively helped the company make their model <em>seem</em> more ethical, while their training data probably didn‚Äôt fundamentally change, and hence the model probably still encodes the harmful stereotypes that could manifest themselves in other ways. Consider how in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06323">Dall-E 2</a> the gender and identity terms were randomly added to make outputs seem more diverse, as opposed to showing the default identity groups (read: White Men).</p>

<p>So, should we just forgo studying ‚Äúclosed‚Äù models from the ethics angle? Of course not: <strong>independent analysis on commercial systems is strictly necessary. But we need to figure out ways to do this without providing companies with free data with which to mask the symptoms of the underlying problem.</strong> Here are some alternatives that may lean on skillsets that NLP researchers are still developing, and perhaps will be strengthened by collaborations with experts in HCI and social sciences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>User studies on whether people trust the over-simplified chatbot answers, how likely they are to verify information, whether students use it in ways that actually improves their learning outcomes, and interventions that promote safer use practices. This kind of work focuses on the potential effects of these models, given the known phenomenon of automation bias, and any negative findings can only be refuted with a public user study.</li>
  <li>Discussing and documenting instances of real-world harms, where they can be traced to the model (akin to the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922">Stochastic Parrots</a> paper). Ideally, such cases would require not only a fix, but also public acknowledgment and hopefully compensation.</li>
  <li>User studies of various demographic cohorts, to see if the system works equally well for them in different real-world tasks: something with qualitative evaluation, where a fix would require obtaining better training data for that cohort. But this kind of work would need to somehow avoid producing too much concrete evidence that could be used to simply ‚Äúpatch‚Äù the output.</li>
  <li>Studies not just of these systems, but on their intended and real impact on society. We need a lot of research on system-level issues where a ‚Äúfix‚Äù would require changes to the business model and/or the way these systems are presented and marketed. An obvious example is the jobs that are too risky to be automated with the unreliable, biased, hallucination-prone systems that we currently have. For instance, do policy-makers jump on the opportunity to hire fewer teachers, and what kinds of schools are more likely to be sent down that path?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="we-develop-a-more-efficient-solution-than-model-x">‚ÄúWe develop a more efficient solution than model X‚Äù:</h3>

<p>The reviewers would likely (and rightly) expect us to show that we improve efficiency while maintaining a similar level of performance, which means we inherit all the above evaluation issues. Also, we likely don‚Äôt even have enough details about the training of the ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù, including its computational costs, the amount and source of energy invested in it, etc.</p>

<h2 id="we-do-have-options">We Do Have Options!</h2>

<p>Dear members of the NLP community: the good news is that if you‚Äôd like to do‚Ä¶ you know‚Ä¶ actual <em>research</em> on language models, you do have open options, and more of them will probably be coming, as the cost of training goes down. <strong>Here are a few examples of models that come not only with reasonable descriptions of their training data, but even tools to query it</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>What about the reviewers who might say ‚Äúbut where‚Äôs GPT-4?‚Äù</strong> Here‚Äôs what you can do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Preemptively discuss in your paper why you don‚Äôt provide e.g. chatGPT results as a baseline, before your paper is submitted.  If necessary, use the arguments in this post in your rebuttals to reviewers.</li>
  <li>Preemptively raise the issue with the chairs of the conference you plan to submit to, to ask if they have a policy against such superficial popularity-driven reviews. The ACL 2023 <a href="https://2023.aclweb.org/blog/review-acl23/#2-check-for-lazy-thinking">policy</a> didn‚Äôt cover this, since the problem became apparent after the submission deadline, but it can be extended by future chairs. We will be following any policy discussions related to this in ACL conferences; if you have any comments, or if there are any major developments and if you‚Äôd like us to keep you in the loop - please use this <a href="https://forms.gle/N2Gakzk8xF6V9aTr5">form</a>.</li>
  <li>As a reviewer or chair, if you see someone insisting on closed baselines - side with the authors and push back.</li>
  <li>Discuss these matters openly in your own community; as reviewers, we can continue to educate and influence each other to drive our norms to a better place.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another question outside of the scope of this post, but that could be brought up for community discussion in the future, is whether the ‚Äúclosed‚Äù models should be accepted as regular conference submissions (in direct competition with ‚Äúopen‚Äù work for conference acceptance and best paper awards) ‚Äì or perhaps it is time to reconsider the role of the ‚Äúindustry‚Äù track.</p>

<p><strong>Our community is at a turning point, and you can help to direct the new community norms to follow science rather than hype ‚Äì both as an author and as a reviewer</strong>. The more people cite and study the best available open solutions, the more we incentivize open and transparent research, and the more likely it is that the next open solution will be much better. After all, it is our tradition of open research that has made our community so successful.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="addendum-counter-arguments"><strong>Addendum: counter-arguments</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Train-test overlap and uninspected training data has always been an issue, ever since we started doing transfer learning with word2vec and onwards. Why protest now?</strong></p>

<p>People have in fact been raising that issue many times before. Again, even OpenAI itself devoted a big chunk of the GPT-3 paper to the issues with benchmark data contamination. The fact that an issue is old doesn‚Äôt make it a non-issue; it rather makes us a field with a decade of methodological debt, which doesn‚Äôt make sense to just keep accruing.</p>

<p><strong>The-Closed-Model-Everybody-Is-Talking-About does seem to work better for this task than my model or open alternatives, how can I just ignore it and claim state-of-the-art?</strong></p>

<p>Don‚Äôt. ‚ÄúState-of-the-art‚Äù claims expire in a few months anyway. Be more specific, and just show improvement over the best open solution. Let‚Äôs say that in your task ChatGPT is clearly, obviously better than open alternatives, based on your own small testing with your own examples. What you don‚Äôt know is whether this is mostly due to some clever model architecture, or some proprietary data. In the latter case, your scientific finding would be‚Ä¶ that models work best on data similar to what they were trained on. Not exactly revolutionary.</p>

<p>Also, ask yourself: are you sure that the impressive behavior you are observing is the result of pure generalization? As mentioned above, there is no way to tell how similar your test examples are to the training data. And that training data could include examples submitted by other researchers working on this topic, examples that were not part of any public dataset.</p>

<p><strong>The-Closed-Model-Everybody-Is-Talking-About does seem to work better for this task than my model or open alternatives, how can I just ignore it and not build on it?</strong></p>

<p>That has indeed been the pathway to many, many NLP publications in the past: take an existing problem and the newest thing-that-everybody-is-talking-about, put them together, show improvement over previous approaches, publish. The problem is that with an API-access closed model you do not actually ‚Äúbuild‚Äù on it; at best you formulate new prompts (and hope that they transfer across different model versions). If your goal is engineering, if you just need something that works - this might be sufficient. But if you are after a scientific contribution to machine learning theory or methods - this will necessarily reduce the perceived value of your work for the reviewers. And if the claim is that you found some new ‚Äúbehavior‚Äù that enables your solution, and hasn‚Äôt been noticed before - you will still need to show that this ‚Äúbehavior‚Äù cannot be explained by the training data.</p>

<p><strong>Whatever we may say, The-Closed-Model-Everybody-Is-Talking-About is on everyone‚Äôs minds. People are interested in it. If I don‚Äôt publish on it, somebody else will and get more credit than me.</strong></p>

<p>Well, that is a personal choice: what do you want the credit for and who do you want recognition from? Publishing on the ‚Äúhottest‚Äù thing might work short-term, but, as shown above, if we simply follow the traditional NLP research narratives with these models as new requisite baselines in place of BERT, our work will be either fundamentally divorced from the basic principles of research methodology, or extremely short-lived, or both. Imagine looking at the list of your published papers 10 years from now: do you want it to be longer, or containing more things that you are proud of long-term?</p>

<p>Are there other ways to study these models that would not run into these issues? We discussed some such ways for ethics-oriented research, perhaps there are other options as well.</p>

<p><strong>Can‚Äôt we just study very made-up examples that are unlikely to have been in training data?</strong></p>

<p>First of all, if the point is to learn something about what that model does with real data - very artificial examples could be handled in some qualitatively different way.</p>

<p>Second, at this point you need to be sure that you are way more original than all those other folks who tested chatGPT for several months. Especially since the data used for RLHF comes from interactions with GPT3 - perhaps even your own!</p>

<p>Third, you would still need to know what part actually hasn‚Äôt been seen. For example, ChatGPT was <a href="https://twitter.com/tqbf/status/1598513757805858820?s=20">reported</a> to write a fable about a peanut butter sandwich stuck in a VCR, in King James Bible style, and that example got subsequently shared in dozens of media articles. This <em>is</em> a cool example, but what exactly is it that we believe to be impressive? The style transfer, the knowledge that things get stuck in VCRs, the plausible instructions? The degree of impressiveness of each one of these depends on what was in the training data. And even the impressiveness of the ability to tie these things together still depends on what combinations of ‚Äúskills‚Äù were seen in training, and whether this is in fact a pure language model behavior, and not some combination of pipeline components.</p>

<p>We tried to reproduce that answer, but accidentally typed ‚ÄúCVR‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúVCR‚Äù. The result was very illuminating. We got generic instructions that could have come from something like WikiHow: how to wipe off something sticky off something electric. Which, of course, is no good here: a sandwich includes a large piece of bread, which you would need to remove by hand rather than by wiping it off. But the best part is that the model later ‚Äúadmitted‚Äù it had no idea what ‚ÄúCVR‚Äù was! (Indeed, large language models don‚Äôt inherently ‚Äúknow‚Äù anything about the world). And then, when prompted for ‚ÄúVCR‚Äù, apparently the directive to maintain consistency within the dialogue overruled whatever it could have said about ‚ÄòVCR‚Äù‚Ä¶ so we got the same wrong instructions.</p>

	<img src="/assets/images/20230330161005.png" />
</figure>

<p>What did go without a hitch is the paraphrasing in the King James style. But it‚Äôs hard to imagine that paraphrasing was not an intended-and-trained-for ‚Äúcapability‚Äù, or that this style was not well represented in a large web-based corpus - o ye of little faith.</p>

<p>Does it work well? Yes. Is it a magical ‚Äúemergent‚Äù property? No. Can we develop another paraphrasing system and meaningfully compare it to this one? Also no. And this is where it stops being relevant for NLP research. <em>That which is not open and reasonably reproducible cannot be considered a requisite baseline.</em></p>

</figure>

<p>When the discussion about large pre-trained generative models hits the question of ‚Äúwhat about all this work of artists, programmers and writers that is used in commercial products/models without their knowledge or consent?‚Äù, one of the arguments for why this is ok is the comparison of such models to latent search engines. It goes something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>As a human, you can and do search for inspiration in other people‚Äôs writing, code snippets and art. A generative model is similar, it just provides a convenient interface for a search over a huge amount of data as you go.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Side note: this is about the ‚Äúlatent search‚Äù or ‚Äúsynthesis‚Äù of the training data that the generative models perform in the process of their regular generation process. There is a related, but separate discussion about using models as a replacement for index-based search engines. For example, <a class="citation" href="#MetzlerTayEtAl_2021_Rethinking_search_making_domain_experts_out_of_dilettantes">(Metzler, Tay, Bahri, &amp; Najork, 2021)</a> sets out a vision of models as ‚Äúdomain experts‚Äù generating authoritative answers to any questions that the user might have. <a class="citation" href="#ShahBender_2022_Situating_Search">(Shah &amp; Bender, 2022)</a> challenge this vision by discussing the many kinds of behavior that search users need to undertake which would simply not be supported by a ‚Äúdomain expert‚Äù model trying to generate one definitive answer (e.g. learning more before refining their question, considering the list of options, the incentives behind different sources, etc).</p>

<p>So what‚Äôs wrong with the ‚Äúlatent search engine‚Äù view of generative models?</p>

<p>It is obviously true that autoregressive language models do search for the most probable completion based on the prompt. And it is equally true that human writing and art is conditioned on the inputs encountered by the said humans in their lives, as well as relevant inputs that were deliberately sought out in response to a particular challenge. In literary studies and art there is the notion of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertextuality">intertextuality</a></em> <a class="citation" href="#Bakhtin_1981_Discourse_in_novel">(Bakhtin, 1981; Kristeva, 1980; Barthes, 1977)</a>, covering a wide range of ways in which different texts/artworks are related (or perceived to be related by the reader), such as allusion, quotation, parody etc.</p>

<p>But there are a few important limitations to this analogy, including the fundamental differences in the mechanism behind the generative models and  the human inspiration, the potential scale of societal impact for commercial models, and a very different set of stakeholders and benefactors. This post focuses on one particular point in which the search engine analogy breaks down: the attribution problem.</p>

<h2 id="the-attribution-problem">The attribution problem</h2>

<p>When you use a search engine, you find a specific idea, artwork or code snippet for which you clearly see the source. There is a reference (even if the source is only known as stackoverflow user02348). Importantly, there is <em>zero</em> illusion that any thought/artwork/code is just there to be freely appropriated as your own work. If your search space is not the web but your own memory or life experience, you still usually know the sources for things that are citation-worthy (or you go on Twitter asking people ‚Äúwhat was that movie/book/project/paper that had/did X?‚Äù)</p>

<p>If you are a researcher, you likely have something like  <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> to track references for you, and a huge database of books and papers. Even if your source by itself was sourced from elsewhere, and even if someone said the same thing without your knowing it ‚Äì your credibility before your readers (and yourself) requires that you disclose the references that you do know. In the process of doing so, you will necessarily have to make sure that you actually believe the source to be reliable, and that you are aware of its role in your own reasoning.</p>

<p>Note that the attribution problem goes both ways: claiming full credit for the result of your work is possible if and only if you know and cite your sources. This is completely orthogonal to the degree of originality. Let‚Äôs say I publish this blog post and then I find that exactly the same text has already been published by someone else: I would still know that what <em>I</em> published was my own work. On the other hand, if instead of writing this blog post I asked GPT-3 to generate it, and even got exactly the same result - I could not claim any contribution at all. In publishing that text as my own, my role would be only to say ‚ÄúI interpret this as coherent text and agree with its content‚Äù (that‚Äôs what I think Jack Clark did when he <a href="https://twitter.com/jackclarkSF/status/1575525910643474435">used</a> synthetic text as part of his Congress testimony). And what if I used GPT-3 to get ‚Äúideas‚Äù about what to write next - i.e. generating coherent sections of text that I would then edit - what exactly would I claim then?  Not sure. But the ideas, the style, the amount of background knowledge etc. would all be only partially mine.</p>

<p>There was a recent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/xlvygv/artifical_intelligence_allows_me_to_get_straight/">Reddit discussion</a> of how GPT-3 starts to get popular with students aiming to avoid doing their essays. Apart from the students‚Äô completely misunderstanding the point of the exercise, and the waste of the teachers‚Äô time, this discussion highlighted an idea that the AI-assisted writer actually gets the credit not for the writing, but for the ‚Äústreet smarts‚Äù: their ability to game the system and get high grades, even if their language skills are not so great. Some might be tempted to say that this is just like using a spellchecker or a service like Grammarly to improve one‚Äôs writing, but it seems clear that generating a full or partial draft is qualitatively different: you get help not only with the linguistic form, but also the content.</p>

<h2 id="but-arent-people-doing-the-same-thing">But aren‚Äôt people doing the same thing?</h2>

<p>Yes, of course people build on other people‚Äôs work all the time. If you want to use something, you can do that - but society has worked out quite a few norms about how much of your own work has to go into the result. And because those norms have evolved over time, we are usually quite aware of our sources. Maybe not all of them, but the important ones for sure.</p>

<p>Any musician has listened to other music that influenced them. Art students go to galleries, and creative writing students read other people‚Äôs books. They and/or their teachers may even deliberately curate what they are exposed to, so as to get to a particular result. And all of them can give an interview with some account of their formative influences. That account will be incomplete and not coinciding with what the critics think, but that‚Äôs not the point: only that people do generally retain at least some memories of things that ended up very important for them.</p>

<p>Another key difference is that if they aim to be an original artist/musician/writer, while they build on prior work, the point is always to add enough of their own thinking that the next generation has something to similarly learn from <em>them</em> (and not only their ‚Äòsources‚Äô). It is far from clear that we get that same degree of creativity from generative models.</p>

<p>With regard to AI art in particular: I‚Äôm not an artist at all, but it seems that it‚Äôs actually the style (shapes, color schemes etc) rather than just the particular images/artifacts that the artist spends a lifetime developing, and that also brings them professional recognition. They seem to very much disagree that it is ok to just appropriate that <a class="citation" href="#Heikkila_2022_This_artist_is_dominating_AI-generated_art_And_hes_not_happy_about_it">(Heikkil√§, 2022)</a>. <a href="https://spawning.ai/">Spawning AI</a> has built a <a href="https://haveibeentrained.com/">tool</a> for artists to detect when their work has been part of popular training datasets.</p>

<p>In conclusion: no, generative models are <em>not</em> doing the same kind of latent search over the possible things they could ‚Äúsay‚Äù as the humans do when they produce texts or art. A key difference is that for humans it is not only a cognitive activity driven by content considerations, but also a social activity. We are acutely aware of when attribution is needed, we provide that attribution, and we expect attribution in return. Granted, different people may have a different sense of when attribution is appropriate (based on their personal experience, familiarity with a subject, the social norms in their environment, etc.) - but that does not make the fundamental principle any less real.</p>

<h2 id="counter-arguments">Counter-arguments</h2>

<p>In the spirit of discussion, here are some of the counter-arguments I have seen, and my responses to them.</p>

<h3 id="generative-models-are-sufficiently-creative">Generative models are sufficiently creative</h3>

<p>To claim that a generative model is sufficiently creative to not worry about attribution, we would first need to define ‚Äúcreativity‚Äù. Some bring up examples like DALL-E‚Äôs <a href="https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/">avocado chairs</a>. To me, the creativity here is exhibited by the human who formulated the crazy prompt, while the model demonstrates compositionality in being able to recombine the visual ‚Äúconcepts‚Äù it had learned (in this case it had learned ‚Äúchair‚Äù, ‚Äúwood‚Äù, and ‚Äúavocado‚Äù, as well as the visual schema ‚Äúchair + material‚Äù). Most of us cannot draw well, so pretty much any execution would look impressive. But consider what this compositional skill would look like in the language domain, where we are all proficient enough: the model learned ‚ÄúJohn had a coffee‚Äù and ‚ÄúMary had a tea‚Äù, and it was then able to produce ‚ÄúJohn had a tea‚Äù. Does that look as impressively creative as the avocado chair image?</p>

<p>I also wouldn‚Äôt interpret creativity as randomness (e.g. as controlled by the temperature setting of GPT-3). If I were to get the writer‚Äôs block and had to resort to random writing prompts to get me unstuck, that would rather be a symptom of a <em>lack</em> of creativity, wouldn‚Äôt it? Furthermore, with the current models increasing the randomness of generation is likely to sacrifice the factual correctness of the generated data, as it necessarily moves further away from the training distribution - and there are no mechanisms for conceptual consistency. Creativity/nonsense is not an acceptable trade-off in most scenarios where the generated text is anchored to the real world or some long-form narrative.</p>

<p>Finally, ‚Äúcreativity‚Äù may be discussed in publications on AI art or AI-human collaborations as some external characteristic of the generated text/artwork, scored by critics on some aesthetic dimensions, as in <a class="citation" href="#HitsuwariUedaEtAl_2022_Does_human-AI_collaboration_lead_to_more_creative_art">(Hitsuwari, Ueda, Yun, &amp; Nomura, 2022)</a>. I would argue that this is also not the relevant notion of creativity for this discussion. Since we are talking about a machine learning system, evaluation of any aesthetic properties of its output has the same problem as any other benchmarks: unless we know what the system saw in training, we cannot tell whether it actually acquired some ability or just parrots the seen examples. So far I have seen no studies of very large models given all their training data (given that this data is typically not made fully publicly available in a query-able form). Since fundamentally the current models are optimized to produce a statistically likely completion of the current prompt, the burden of proof is on the side that claims creativity.</p>

<p>What we do know from the studies with smaller models is that they can and do reproduce passages of training data verbatim <a class="citation" href="#CarliniTramerEtAl_2021_Extracting_Training_Data_from_Large_Language_Models">(Carlini et al., 2021; Carlini et al., 2022)</a>, inter alia. The capacity for memorization and, hence, plagiarism would increase with size <a class="citation" href="#LeeLeEtAl_2022_Do_Language_Models_Plagiarize">(Lee, Le, Chen, &amp; Lee, 2022)</a>. Given that, I would argue that even if we had some general proof of <em>capacity</em> for generative models to synthesize meaningful and original content, it would not be enough: after all, humans also <em>can</em> be creative, but teachers still suspect student plagiarism on a case by case basis. For a statistical learner, how creative (or trustworthy) a given generation is would likely depend on how much evidence it had, and how similar the different datapoints were. So unless the company selling the model provides some guarantees of originality in specific cases, it simply passes the responsibility for the potential plagiarism on to its unwitting customers.</p>

<h3 id="can-we-just-add-references">Can we just add references?</h3>

<p>When presenting their vision of a ‚Äúdomain expert‚Äù end-to-end information retrieval, <a class="citation" href="#MetzlerTayEtAl_2021_Rethinking_search_making_domain_experts_out_of_dilettantes">(Metzler, Tay, Bahri, &amp; Najork, 2021)</a> argue for a model that does add some references, and moreover strives to present ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù for controversial topics. Perhaps it would be an easy fix for the attribution problem - if we just added pointers to the training data examples that were the most similar to the generated output?</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre writing a deep learning blog post about self-attention in Transformers. Let‚Äôs say that your ‚Äúwriting aid‚Äù model would give you the following combination of sentences:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The self-attention mechanism in Transformers is able to compute pair-wise relations between patches globally, consequently achieving feature interactions across a long range. It is‚Ä¶ regarded as a mapping of query and key/value pairs to an output, each of which being represented by a vector. A well-known concern with self-attention‚Ä¶ is the quadratic time and memory complexity, which can hinder model scalability in many settings.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of these sentences actually come from different research papers. Augmented with links to those papers, the same paragraph would look like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The self-attention mechanism in Transformers is able to compute pair-wise relations between patches globally, consequently achieving feature interactions across a long range. [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.00462v2.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.00462v2.pdf</a>] It is‚Ä¶ regarded as a mapping of query and key/value pairs to an output, each of which being represented by a vector [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03052.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03052.pdf</a>]. A well-known concern with self-attention‚Ä¶ is the quadratic time and memory complexity, which can hinder model scalability in many settings. [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.06732.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.06732.pdf</a>].</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The key difference is that the first paragraph <em>looks</em> like something actually ‚Äúdone‚Äù by the model, and you might be tempted to actually use it. The references destroy the illusion of the attribution-free text: unless you are comfortable simply copying phrases from other people‚Äôs work, the ‚Äúwriting aid‚Äù illusion falls apart.</p>

<p>Admittedly, this example is exaggerated: perhaps only some part of the generated text would be so clearly plagiarized. Perhaps it would only happen occasionally. But without these references the attribution norms in scientific community would still be broken. And with them, it would mean that you‚Äôre relying on GPT-3 for the high-level thinking behind your research. Which would make sense depending on (a) on the degree to which you believe it capable of such thinking, (b) if so - the degree to which you are comfortable taking credit for thinking that is not your own.</p>

<p><a class="citation" href="#ShahBender_2022_Situating_Search">(Shah &amp; Bender, 2022)</a> make the case that the references approach is insufficient even for the ‚Äúdomain expert‚Äù QA model envisaged by <a class="citation" href="#MetzlerTayEtAl_2021_Rethinking_search_making_domain_experts_out_of_dilettantes">(Metzler, Tay, Bahri, &amp; Najork, 2021)</a>: the model may end up being the arbiter of truth for cases that are far from resolved, may present ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù on topics like the flat earth theory, and may obscure the real sources of information behind the citation (e.g. something called ‚ÄúXYZ clinic‚Äù may actually be a homeopathy provider with no medical credentials). Of course, there are cases in which the answer is straightforward enough to trust the current models with - but unfortunately we can‚Äôt easily tell which cases are ‚Äúsafe‚Äù.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-go-deep-enough-everything-has-a-reference">If you go deep enough, everything has a reference.</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>If you go deep enough, everything has a reference. Nobody expects attribution for basic algebra or the English alphabet. Nobody has ethical qualms about writing with Grammarly or spell checkers. Why demand attribution for abstract ideas or artistic styles?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>True, when we write academic articles nowadays, nobody expects you to provide the trail of references all the way down to Aristotle. But few people would say that taking someone‚Äôs recent NeurIPS paper and republishing it would be ok. Yes, it is a continuum, but it‚Äôs still real.</p>

<p>What exactly is common knowledge and what deserves a reference at a given point in time varies by person, depending on their domain knowledge and principles. Still, everybody has a fairly clear idea of what their own boundaries are. Would you personally be comfortable with changing some variable names in a StackOverflow snippet and passing it as your own work? Would you tell your child it‚Äôs ok to copy-paste essay passages from public domain sources - after all, it‚Äôs not illegal? How about if you hear an apt metaphor in someone‚Äôs keynote that you haven‚Äôt heard anywhere else - would you say that it‚Äôs ‚Äújust English‚Äù and use it as your own? Whatever your answers are to these questions - you have these answers, which means that you have your own attribution norms. They matter to <em>you</em>. And part of the reason you have this specific set of norms is that you know that this is what the people around you expect.</p>

<h3 id="fair-use">‚ÄúFair use‚Äù</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>This is just luddism. The printing press put the calligraphers out of a job, and the world is better off this way. The notions of copyright and intellectual property are obsolete and will soon dissolve in ‚Äúfair use‚Äù. If that puts artists/writers/programmers out of work - so what, society just needs to adapt.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The printing press wasn‚Äôt literally powered by the work of all the calligraphers in the world, taken and used commercially without their knowledge or consent - especially at a time when at least some protection against that already exists in contemporaneous laws. ‚ÄúFair use‚Äù may sound like a reasonable approach for academic research or for individual creators producing AI-assisted content (with proper source attribution), but that‚Äôs not what is under discussion - it‚Äôs the AI companies‚Äô right to use any data they can get hold of to train <em>commercial</em> models, without sharing any proceeds with the original creators or even letting them know their work was used. That fight is far from over, and the few available court decisions (such as the ongoing <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/linkedin-loses-latest-appeal-in-ongoing-data-scraping-case/622333/">LinkedIn case</a>) are on a case-by-case basis rather than something that the companies can already use as a blanket permission. An investigation for an actual lawsuit is underway with respect to GitHub CoPilot <a class="citation" href="#JosephSaveriLawFirmButterick_2022_GitHub_Copilot_investigation">(Joseph Saveri Law Firm &amp; Butterick, 2022)</a>.</p>

<p>I am not sure what kind of adaptations on the part of society are being envisaged. Let us imagine one possible scenario: you are a programmer in a world dominated by a future CoPilot-like system which everybody uses, and which is trained on all public code. Any new public code of yours is fed to that system, and everybody else is instantly able to use it. Since there is no attribution, your public work can no longer help you to build up reputation, community and a professional profile that would be well known outside your current company, which would make it harder to change jobs should anything go wrong. Your employer knows this, and tweaks a few HR policies.</p>

<p>Maybe the future CoPilot owner works out some licensing scheme which gives you some royalties when your code snippets are used? This is where the platform power comes in, and we wish we hadn‚Äôt been so enthusiastic about ‚Äúfair use‚Äù for commerce. Fun fact: only 0.96% of the 7 million artists on Spotify made even $5K in 2020 <a class="citation" href="#Smith_2021_13400_Artists_Out_of_7_Million_Earn_$50k_or_More_From_Spotify_Yearly">(Smith, 2021)</a>. Only 0.19% (13,400 artists) out of 7 million artists were popular enough to make $50K a year.</p>

I was able to attend thanks to <a href="http://www.winlp.org/winlp-emnlp-2021/">WiNLP</a> travel award, for their panel on the role of peer review in diversifying NLP. <em>This was the first ever *ACL hybrid conference, and the chairs deserve applause for all their hard work.</em></p>

<p>This post is meant not as a criticism, but rather as a post-mortem that would hopefully be useful for organizers of future events. I can only share my own experience, and would love to hear from others. This post does <em>not</em> offer a comprehensive solution for to how to do this better - only some thoughts and comments.</p>

<h2 id="segregation-between-on-site-and-virtual-events">Segregation between on-site and virtual events</h2>

<p>The fundamental issue is that the on-site conference experience is complete enough that people who are on-site have more than enough things to do without checking in on the virtual part. There were fewer people on-site than usual, but I think even 50 people would probably just keep chatting to each other full-time (as they did in the early days of ACL). Probably this time it was worse than average because this is the first on-site meeting after a year of lockdowns, and thus it was too much joy to see human faces again to exchange that for zoom. But I don‚Äôt think that this factor would ever go away.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if we are on-site it means we are tired from traveling and likely also jetlagged. I knew very well that virtual part was also going on, but I even missed a big chunk of the on-site program, because I just didn‚Äôt have the energy physically (and also had non-conference urgent stuff to do for ARR). The result was that I made it to the grand total of 1 virtual poster in the whole week.</p>

<p>A part of the problem is that our conferences are just generally too big. In a regular pre-pandemic on-site conference there were already too many parallel sessions going on, and thus it was already hard enough to pick and choose, and get to the right rooms at the right time. If the hybrid format offers the on-site attendees a subset of that program that is ‚Äúlive‚Äù, and the rest of the talks are recorded anyway, I think simply following the on-site part will always be a too-tempting option. If some of the parallel sessions are virtual, the topical division imo wouldn‚Äôt offer sufficient incentive to attend them just for their topic, because most of us seem to have many research interests, and will likely always find some exciting work that happens to be presented on-site.</p>

<p>This is why parallel on-site / virtual sessions are problematic. Unfortunately, they are also problematic when they are consecutive, because of the limited working hours in the on-site location. In day 1 there was a 9am invited talk, 4 oral sessions until 18:15, 45 min for dinner break, and then another 2-hour virtual poster session 19:00-21:00. Speaking for myself, I just cannot absorb this much of a conference in a day. I do see that evening/night virtual events make sense to accommodate the presenters who are inevitably going to be in some other time zone than the conference location, but this also inevitably contributes to the segregation.</p>

<p>And this segregation is obviously not great. <strong>The people who can afford to travel to conferences are the ones who have money, visas, health, AND time - and EACH of these criteria cuts off a LOT of people.</strong> Money-wise, the student &amp; diversity travel awards are better than nothing, but not a solution, as there will never be enough awards for all who deserves to come. Personally, I had zero travel support during my PhD, and without a visit to NAACL sponsored by ACL student research workshop I would probably <em>not</em> be here today. I am acutely aware that my getting that funding likely meant that someone else didn‚Äôt, and maybe they were/would be a better researcher.</p>

<p>For all of these reasons, not to mention the environment, I have previously advocated for fully switching to virtual conferences. I do see that this would be taking a lot of joy out of science (for people with money, visas, health and time), and so there is little appetite for such extreme measures - especially in that demographic. I am also aware that students need to network with that demographic to find jobs, and those students who do get to conferences get an important competitive advantage, which they will not want to lose. But if the community decides that these two factors outweigh inclusivity and the solution is hybrid conferences - I really don‚Äôt think we have a recipe that works for both sides yet.</p>

<h2 id="technical-aspects-of-organization-notes-on-different-types-of-events-from-an-on-site-attendee-perspective">Technical aspects of organization: notes on different types of events from an on-site attendee perspective</h2>

<h3 id="keynotes--invited-talks">Keynotes &amp; invited talks</h3>

<p>Conference keynotes work great in the hybrid format, because only one thing is going on, it‚Äôs generally well attended, and everybody is there from both channels.</p>

<p>The same was generally true of invited talks for workshops, even though there were several workshops in parallel, and so more competition for the audience.</p>

<h3 id="on-site-talks">On-site talks</h3>

<p>In the on-site talks the presenter being virtual or on-site didn‚Äôt make a lot of difference for me. But with only 5 minutes for questions, having to locate &amp; open the chat on-site often seemed like too much effort. So I ended up mostly not doing it, unless I already had laptop open.</p>

<p>Questions to papers work better as asynchronous chat, but it‚Äôd be nice to have some dedicated slots in the conference program to do that. And authors should get notified when there are questions for their papers. I had 2 papers, jetlag, and a workshop to organize, and so definitely did not have the presence of mind to keep checking on those chats.</p>

<p>Even without the hybrid thing, I think poster format for conferences is just inherently better than 15 min talks, and I heard many people say the same. Way more interactivity, can go in-depth and/or chat &amp; brainstorm as needed.</p>

<h3 id="posters">Posters</h3>

<p>Hybrid poster sessions are a challenge. To have virtual attendees in the live poster sessions we‚Äôd have to have some kind of conference robots, which is just too expensive. Having separate on-site &amp; virtual sessions deprives the virtual crowd of the former. If we have the on-site presenters also present virtually a second time, they get double exposure, which seems unfair to virtual-only participants.</p>

<p>Shall we just give up on physical posters and switch to gather-town in perpetuity (provided that its infrastructure scales to be fast enough?) Yes, it‚Äôs amazing to be able to talk to people live, but see above: it doesn‚Äôt seem to be possible to do it in an inclusive way. Plus we have the lovely task, cost and eco footprint of printing &amp; carrying those posters. In EMNLP 2019 I nearly lost my poster in Hong Kong airport, because I was so jetlagged after the flight!</p>

<p>While live interaction with <em>people</em> at the poster feels better (if you‚Äôre among the lucky ones to be on-site), I do think it is strictly inferior to gather-town in terms of interaction with the <em>content</em>: it‚Äôs a lot easier to take notes, check up any papers mentioned in the discussion, tweet interesting stuff, look up people you ‚Äòrun‚Äô into. Have you ever come back from an on-site poster session with a phone full of poster photos that you never touched since? I certainly have.</p>

<h3 id="panels">Panels</h3>

<p>I was an on-site panelist with two virtual panelists at WiNLP. The panel was great, but it presented a challenge I‚Äôve never thought about: camera positioning. The room had the standard setup of a large screen with the projected speaker view for the online participants, and in front of that screen was a chair for the on-site speaker facing the on-site audience.</p>

<p>Since the screen projecting the speaker view was behind me, I couldn‚Äôt see who I was talking to, and so had to have a laptop with zoom on a table in front of me. The end result was that the on-site people saw me stare at laptop in front of them, and virtual people saw a side view of me staring at the laptop. I honestly don‚Äôt know how this could be resolved. I hope this gets read by an academic whose hobby happens to be videography.</p>

<h2 id="underline-grievances">Underline grievances</h2>

<p>Separate from the hybrid format is the heap of trouble with Underline.io, which EMNLP used for the hybrid part. This time the virtual attendance cost more, but the platform experience did not improve to justify that. As in ACL and NAACL 2021, it was slow, and the linking between papers, videos, live zooms and associated chats added a ton of friction. A one-click feature ‚Äúadd this to my schedule in my time zone‚Äù should NOT be so hard. On-site, we had to look for things both on underline, in whova, and in the printed handbook, as they sometimes had different information.</p>

<p>I did <em>not</em> expect that in the closing remarks the speakers had to say ‚Äúnext‚Äù for someone to press the button to advance the slides. Definitely didn‚Äôt seem like we‚Äôre reaching for AGI yet‚Ä¶</p>

<p>But this was the main conference. It was a lot worse for the workshops and tutorials, which did <em>not</em> even have any schedules on the platform - except for their own websites, which would be harder for the attendees to cross-compare and make a composite schedule of.</p>

<p>The on-site problems were so numerous that it‚Äôd be funny if it was not borderline disastrous. I heard that the crowdwourcing tutorial was assigned to an empty room without the set-up gear, and they had to run between rooms!</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://insights-workshop.github.io">Insights from Negative Results</a> workshop, we started by losing 20 scheduled minutes because they gave us the same zoom link as another workshop. Then in another talk our on-site mike died and we couldn‚Äôt get through to the speaker who went overtime. And then they re-logged in for some reason, and that kicked the organizers out of the zoom altogether. For dessert, my own pre-submitted poster was simply missing in gather.town. They don‚Äôt even let people know if there are any problems with uploaded pdfs or videos. The underline team was on-site in sufficient numbers, but I couldn‚Äôt help wishing that I did not have to fetch them all the time.</p>

<p>I was part of the team for EMNLP 2020, which seems to have so far have delivered the best virtual conference experience with a combination of miniconf, gather.town and rocketchat. This was a <em>ton</em> of work, and I totally see why subsequent conferences went with underline because it just seems like a one-stop infrastructure solution. But underline truly makes the virtual part way worse than it has to be, and they clearly haven‚Äôt adapted their platform based on everything that was said after NAACL and ACL. I doubt they will now. Given that this is a computer science-ish field with tons of money, do we really have to inflict this on ourselves?</p>

<h2 id="location">Location</h2>

<p>A completely orthogonal dimension to the hybrid format and Underline is the location. Which in this case was Punta Cana, Dominican republic. Which looks like this:</p>

<figure>
	<img src="/assets/images/punta-cana.jpeg" />
</figure>

<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong: the Caribbean is magical. I would probably never have made it without this conference, I‚Äôll remember it forever, and I‚Äôm happy I was able to go. I wish everybody else could have seen the palm trees, the sunrise on the beach, the parrots, and everything else.</p>

<p>At the same time, if I were to design a special hell for an academic - I‚Äôd give them a limited time in a tropical beach with turtles to snorkel with, a buffet with infinite supply of mango smoothies‚Ä¶ and a deadline to watch a bunch of talks, or write a grant application, or something like that. In this setup you get tortured by FOMO no matter what you choose to do.</p>

<p>You can also try to compromise, which will probably result in doing a bad job of both options. I honestly tried the student solution of just not sleeping. I lived on 6 hours of sleep for a week to go for a swim before the conference - and I normally need 8-9 hours. Result: still foggy and exhausted, 3 days after I‚Äôm back. I‚Äôm sure the quality of my thinking suffered, and I rambled incoherently to people who deserved better. It also feels profoundly wrong to be at a resort, where everybody relaxes, but you are running between things like it‚Äôs the start of the term.</p>

<p>Kudos for an ingenious solution to Marzena Karpinska, who risked her phone and headphones and literally watched the crowdsourcing tutorial <em>in</em> the pool. Wish someone made waterproof laptops.</p>

<p>So‚Ä¶ if we do have any more conferences in tropical resorts, I‚Äôd suggest to make them at least 2 weeks long, with half a day dedicated to snorkeling, birding, kayaking and everything else that has blissfully nothing to do with research, but is a sin to miss. I can even nominate special chairs for all that!</p>

<p>Another thing I didn‚Äôt expect, but totally should have: there were almost no power outlets, and wifi was patchy and unreliable (probably depending on how many tourists were streaming movies at a given time). Kind of duh, this place is emphatically not meant for work!</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p>Once again: EMNLP 2021 was certainly unforgettable, and I‚Äôm very happy and priviledged to be able to attend it. And the organizers put an insane amount of volunteer work into getting the first hybrid conference to run as smoothly as possible. There is certainly a lot of valuable experience here for future events, as well as plenty of food for thought.</p>]]></content><author><name>Anna Rogers</name></author><category term="howto" /><category term="conferences" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Field notes from EMNLP 2021, the first hybrid *ACL conference.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Text Machine Lab] BERT Busters: Outlier Dimensions that Disrupt Transformers</title><link href="https://hackingsemantics.xyz/2021/bert-busters/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="[Text Machine Lab] BERT Busters: Outlier Dimensions that Disrupt Transformers" /><published>2021-08-31T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-08-31T13:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://hackingsemantics.xyz/2021/bert-busters</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://hackingsemantics.xyz/2021/bert-busters/"><![CDATA[<p>This is a post I wrote during my time in Text Machine Lab: <a href="https://text-machine-lab.github.io/blog/2021/busters/">https://text-machine-lab.github.io/blog/2021/busters/</a>.

Because of the efforts to preserve them and link them up to the paper pages in ACL anthology, they are the bliss for the audience, and greatly improve conference accessibility worldwide. But for the authors they are the curse: because they are pre-recorded, there is an expectation of some degree of polish on the talk, and so the perfectionists may take way more time to prepare and record than just doing the talk live. Also, few of us have a stylish home office to show off, and even fewer majored in film making.</p>

<p>An extra level of complexity is added by the fact that different conferences contract different platforms who host the videos for the duration of the conference, and those platforms may offer more or less convenient recorder software (not to mention the licensing nightmare, which I‚Äôll skip for now). They may also have some format quirks. So far the virtual conferences I attended used either <a href="https://underline.io">Underline</a> or <a href="https://slideslive.com">Slideslive</a>. The former shows regular single-video presentations, while the latter actually has <em>two</em> video streams: the speaker view and the slidesview, the latter usable for navigation.</p>

<p>Each of these platforms has their pros and cons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the current slideslive editor lacks basic things like removing, copying and pasting parts of the video. They are going to release a new version soon, which I got to preview, and which is much better - but it is still a browser-based solution, which offers cross-platform accessibility but not well equipped for either video editing or full access to camera/audio settings.</li>
  <li>Underline offers screen-cast-o-matic recorder and editor. The recorder has a desktop ‚Äúinstaller‚Äù, but seems to be still fundamentally web-based and not giving you much control over the camera &amp; mike. They also do not support Linux.</li>
</ul>

<p>These, and any other platform-specific setups also have the inherent disadvantage that their full functionality is only available while the conference is paying. Since we have to learn how to use <em>some</em> recording/editing tools - wouldn‚Äôt it be better to learn tools we could use at any time (for an invited talk, a lecture, a podcast, etc.)? Also, maybe we could save some money on the services we have to hire, and make conference registrations cheaper?</p>

<p>So‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs my DYI setup for recording talks that can be then uploaded to single or double-view players (vimeo, slideslive, underline, younameit). It is possible to get a nice recording entirely with open-source software. It‚Äôs not harder than an average PyTorch tutorial, and with addition of some commercial software, you can also get the correct captions <em>at the same time</em>.</p>

<h2 id="step-0-equipment">Step 0: equipment</h2>

<p><strong>Minimal setup:</strong> you need a camera and a microphone, and obviously a computer where the presentation will run. The built-in webcam and microphone <em>might</em> do, depending on what they are and how picky you are. Your headphones might also have a built-in mike (although I was severely disappointed with my Sony WH-1000XM3).</p>

<p><strong>My fancy setup:</strong> I used to be a musician in my previous life, so I‚Äôm quite picky about sound. The bottom line with mikes is that you want them to be reasonable quality, in a quiet environment, close to the source of sound (your mouth) and not moving around (as that will create different volume levels). The latter can be achieved either by fixing the mike on yourself (lavalier mikes, headset mikes), or fixing both the mike and yourself (having the mike on the desk or a stand, and not moving).</p>

<p>Caveat: most laptops do <em>not</em> even have a dedicated mike input, even if you have a good mike. In that situation you probably need a USB mike, which essentially works as an external sound card.</p>

<p>In my case, I already was in possession of <a href="https://www.zoom.co.jp/products/handy-recorder/h1-handy-recorder">Zoom H1</a> recorder which does also work as an external sound card. I could use just the mikes on that recorder, but it also has a separate mike input, which I used for my <a href="https://www.rode.com/microphones/lavaliergo">R√∏de lavalier Go</a> (which I love dearly).</p>

<p>As for the video equipment, I‚Äôm really not an expert, but it seems that what matters even more than the camera is the lighting: you need the light on your face to be bright enough and uniform enough, or you‚Äôll get a video that is dark and with unflattering shadows. Depending on your environment, you might be able to just use daylight. The professional setups seem to involve at least two directed lights on both sides of the face.</p>

<p>That is hard on the eyes, so when recording my EACL 2021 tutorial I put the laptop and all the gear on the window sill (with two more windows on either side providing side lighting), so as to face the soft daylight. I had a high-res webcam with autofocus (Logitech HD 1080p), and I thought I could trust it to stay on my face. I was wrong: the light afforded by a cloudy evening in Copenhagen does not suffice. My video ended up quite blurry, and I suspect the autofocus actually made things worse. Proceed with caution.</p>

<p>If you want to remove the background on your speaker view, or replace it with a cool Martian landscape, you will also need something usable as a backdrop: a large piece of solid-colored and smooth fabric (ideally green), and some way to make it hang smoothly behind your chair. Some recorders (such as the one built in Zoom) may have their own filters, which will do a better or worse job of removing your background - but a backdrop will dramatically increase their chances too.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-recording">Step 1: Recording</h2>

<p><strong>Software you‚Äôll need:</strong> <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS Studio</a> (Windows, Linux, Mac)</p>

<p>This is a free, open source, and extremely feature-rich recorder which can do a lot more than we need. I feel quite intimidated by all the settings it has, but luckily we don‚Äôt need all of them.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs the OBS interface. We need to understand two sections: canvas and sources:</p>

<figure>
	<img src="/assets/images/obs-annotated2.png" />
</figure>

<p>When you run OBS Studio for the first time, it may ask you whether you want to optimize for streaming or recording (choose recording), and for the video settings. Choose 30 FPS and 1920x1080 resolution, if available.</p>

<h3 id="single-screen-recording">Single-screen recording</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm going to assume that the target resolution requested by the hosting platform is fullHD 1920x1080 (if not, adjust the instructions accordingly).</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to Settings &gt; Video and set the base canvas resolution to <strong>1920 x 1080</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the main window, click on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> button under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sources</code>. For a screencast recording you will need at least 2 sources: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Audio Input Capture</code> (mike) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Window Capture</code> (slides). Set your input devices and slides window in the properties for these inputs.</li>
  <li><em>Optional: add the speaker view.</em> The above screenshot shows the speaker view on the side of the slides. To create that, prepare slides that are <em>not</em> 16:9 aspect (mine were 4:3), and then add one more input source: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Video Input Capture</code> (webcam). Place it within the canvas, to the left/right side of your slides view. <br /><br />
<em>Optional, advanced: Crop the camera view.</em> Most webcams default to 16:9 aspect ratio, and most of us are not bodybuilders and do not need it to be so wide. So we can crop the webcam view to get it closer to portrait aspect, and have a larger view of the face. Select the webcam view on the canvas, go to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Transform</code> in its context menu, and experiment with how many pixels you want cropped from any side of the camera view. <br /><br />
<em>Optional, also advanced: remove the view of your bedroom.</em> If you have something usable as solid color backdrop (ideally green), position it behind you and go to the context menu of the webcam input source. Go to the context menu on the webcam input, find <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Filters</code>, press the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> button in the bottom left corner. Add the filter called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Chroma key</code>. In its settings, select the key color type of your backdrop and play with the ‚Äúsimilarity‚Äù slider until it removes the background and nothing else. Then you can even make the speaker view <em>overlay</em> the slides like this:</li>
</ol>
<figure>
	<img src="/assets/images/obs-overlay.png" />
</figure>
<p><em>Even more advanced: replace the view of your bedroom.</em> You can add a Martian landscape or whatever as your background. Add one more source of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Image</code> type. Choose the image you like in the properties of that source. Position it on the canvas so that it is behind your webcam view (Context menu of the object on the canvas &gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Order</code> &gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Move up/down</code>).</p>
<ol>
  <li>Optional: add any other filters on your sources that you like and know how to use (context menu on an input &gt; Filters &gt; ‚Äú+‚Äù button in the bottom left corner). I always use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Noise suppression</code> filter on the Audio Input (with RNNoise setting): it decreases the background noise caught by the mike from any humming in the room (fridges, computer fans etc.)</li>
  <li>Check the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Settings</code> &gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hotkeys</code> for the actions of ‚Äúrecording‚Äù and ‚Äústop recording‚Äù. I have them both at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+R</code>.</li>
  <li>Test the whole workflow: start the recording, switch to your slides, do a test slide, stop the recording. OBS Studio simply saves the video file to the location specified in Settings &gt; Output. I save in mp4 format, at ‚Äúhigh quality, medium file size‚Äù setting.</li>
  <li>Record the talk.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="two-screen-recording-for-slideslive">Two-screen recording (for slideslive)</h3>

<p>Slideslive is great in giving us the separate views of speakers and slides, but the disadvantage is that, obviously, you have to record <em>two</em> videos instead of one, and keep them in sync. Most recorders can‚Äôt do that.</p>

<p>The trick to achieve this in OBS Studio is to record a single ultra-wide video that combines both views, and then to split it into two. So the source video would look like this:</p>

<figure>
	<img src="/assets/images/double-video.png" />
</figure>

<p>Here‚Äôs how to make such a recording:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to Settings &gt; Video and set the base canvas resolution to 3840 x 1080. That will give us room for two 1920x1080 views side-by-side.</li>
  <li>Create speaker and slides views as described above, with any filters you like. Move and resize the webcam view and slides view on the canvas until they are perfectly side-by-side.</li>
  <li>Record the talk as described above.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="step-2-editing-the-recording">Step 2: Editing the recording</h2>

<p><em>Minimalist setup</em>: All we need is a video editor with three barebone functions: cut, paste, and crop. <a href="https://shotcut.org/download/">Shotcut</a> is open-source and cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac). Maybe there are even better options (feel free to add suggestions in the comments).</p>

<p>To edit with Shotcut:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Import your video file (with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Open File</code> in the panel) and add it to the timeline using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> button.</li>
  <li>Do any editing you need, using the timeline for navigation. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Space</code> will play the video, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S</code> or the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">][</code> button will create a split point. If there‚Äôs a part of video you‚Äôd like to remove, create split points in its beginning and its end and remove it from the context menu on the undesirable part of the video (or use  the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code> shortcut). You can also cut a part of the video this way and paste it to some other split point.</li>
</ol>

<p>The editor looks like this:</p>

<figure>
	<img src="/assets/images/shotcut.png" />
</figure>

<p><em>Delux setup</em>. I am absolutely in love with <a href="https://descript.com">Descript</a>. It is also a video/audio editor, but it is aimed at people producing podcasts and vlogs, i.e. the use case where the primary concern is not just the visuals, but what is being said. Here‚Äôs what it looks like:</p>

<figure>
	<img src="/assets/images/descript.png" />
</figure>

<p>What Descript does is magic. It makes a transcription of the talk, and then lets you edit the video based on that transcript. Which means - no more rewinding several times to try to find the exact moment of the split. This is lightning fast. You read the transcript, you see the part you don‚Äôt like, you select the text corresponding to that part and you delete it, just like in a text processor. And the video is adjusted and re-synced automatically. It even has the handy feature of automatically detecting and removing all the ‚Äúuhs‚Äù! And it can normalize the volume of the audio, in case it turned out to be uneven.</p>

<p>The con is that it is not free, but (at least in my case) it definitely saves more time then it costs. The mid-tier version costs $12 a month and lets you transcribe 10 hours of video. The $24 top-tier version gives you 30 hours. There is a free tier with 3 hours of transcription, but it caps the resolution at 720p and adds a watermark.</p>

<p>Also, beware that very fine-grained video editing does make the speaker view video look a bit bumpy. If you try to stitch a sentence together using several separate segments ‚Äì it will probably look unnatural. I think it is a lesser evil than making people listen to something wrong or full of ‚Äúuhs‚Äù, but a simple strategy to avoid too fine-grained editing is to simply do the tricky part again, without breaking your recording. Let‚Äôs say you end up with several consecutive takes of a difficult slide, with various degrees of rambling. When you edit in Descript, you see the text you‚Äôre saying, so it‚Äôs easy to simply pick the better version and delete the others. The longer segments you get without editing, the more natural the video will look.</p>

<p>If you use Descript:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a project</li>
  <li>Add your video file</li>
  <li>Auto-transcribe it (will take a couple of minutes)</li>
  <li>Edit the text as desired. The deleted parts of video will be auto-removed accordingly.</li>
  <li>Export the video.</li>
</ol>

<p>Side note: Descript has an interesting security solution. The pro version has the uncanny ability to train a model of your voice, and overdub the parts you wish you said differently (audio only at this point). Which is great for the presenters, but obviously is a security risk, because with enough recordings people could deepfake somebody else‚Äôs voice. Well, in Descript they can‚Äôt do that: to train the model, you have to record a fairly long specific text, so the victim would have to be tricked into reading it aloud.</p>

<h2 id="step-3-splitting-the-recording-only-for-slideslive">Step 3: Splitting the recording (only for slideslive)</h2>

<p>However you did the editing, the result is a cleaned-up version of the original video file. If you made an ultra-wide video intended for slideslive, we also need to split it into <em>two</em> files that slideslive can import.</p>

<p>Using Shotcut, add a crop filter:</p>

<ol>
  <li>click on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Filters</code> in the top panel</li>
  <li>Filter panel will appear on the left. Click <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code>, open the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Video</code> tab, and select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Crop rectangle</code>.</li>
  <li>Set the crop filter so as to remove the right part of your video. At this point we have a 3840 x 1080 video, and we need two 1920 x 1080 videos. Set the dimensions of crop for 1920x1080, and the position to 0,0. This will remove the right-hand side of the video.</li>
  <li>Export the edited video (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">File &gt; Export Video</code>).</li>
  <li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 to export the right-hand side of the video (with the same crop dimensions, but position 1920,0).</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="step-4-subtitles-optional">Step 4: Subtitles (optional)</h2>

<p>Subtitles are a great way to increase accessibility of our videos, but all the specialized terminology + many non-native speakers = captioning disaster. Which is kinda ironic, given that the field is NLP.</p>

<p>The video recording platforms may offer a subtitle editor, but I haven‚Äôt seen anyone singing praise for them so far. The ones I tried are lacking in the keyboard navigation, which makes the process slower. Also the process is inherently frustrating, at least for me: by the time we get to subtitles we‚Äôve already spent too much time trying to record and edit the video, and subtitles are the last hurdle that (a) is a lot of work, (b) not fun, because who likes looking at our own very imperfect videos?</p>

<p>It may be possible to do the subtitles elsewhere and then import them to the platform. Slideslive subtitles editor can import subtitles in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.vtt</code> format: there is no upload link immediately when you upload the videos, but once they generate their own version of the subtitles, they will send you a link to the subtitle editor. There will be an ‚Äúimport‚Äù button there.</p>

<p>If you remember your talk well, the fastest, minimal-effort thing is probably to just download the auto-generated subtitle file from the editor, and do the obvious edits in any text editor. If you need the video to help with the editing, try some other subtitles editor that can work with the given format. A quick search for open-source tools locates <a href="https://nikse.dk/SubtitleEdit/">Subtitle Edit</a> (Windows, Linux) and <a href="https://nikse.dk/SubtitleEdit/Online">its online version that works with local video files</a>.</p>

<p>In my case, I gave up and just paid Descript to be able to edit my video based on text, because then I get exportable transcript/subtitles already as a by-product of video editing. Since the whole editing process is based on text, you can not only remove any bits you don‚Äôt like, but also fix any auto-transcription errors as you go. And then <em>you get both the video and the subtitles at the same time</em>! So - full accessibility with as little work as I can imagine.</p>

<p>One slideslive-specific caveat is that the file exported by Descript has extra metadata not conforming to the vtt format (lines 3-5). Once those lines are removed, the subtitles can be imported to slideslive. I was told that the editor will be improved to handle this automatically.</p>

<h2 id="step-5-thats-it">Step 5: That‚Äôs it!</h2>

<p>Hopefully this worked, and you now have a nice talk recorded in reasonable time.
