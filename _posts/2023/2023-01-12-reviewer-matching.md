As a program chair of ACL'23, I was the lead author for this blog post on the conference website that summarized our approach to peer-review matching: [https://2023.aclweb.org/blog/reviewer-assignment/](https://2023.aclweb.org/blog/reviewer-assignment/)
I was also the lead developer of this approach to matching. Post-mortem analysis of how it worked is available in this report:
