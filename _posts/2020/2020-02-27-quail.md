This is a post I wrote during my time in Text Machine Lab: [https://text-machine-lab.github.io/blog/2020/quail/](https://text-machine-lab.github.io/blog/2020/quail/). It presents an English resource for machine reading comprehension, balanced across 4 domains and 9 question types - and our experience of getting the crowdworkers to generate diverse types of data. There are also some follow-up experiments on instability of benchmark results due to variation in fine-tuning runs and data splits.
